      Logic is the study of consequence. Given a few mathematical statements or facts, we would like to be able to draw some conclusions. For example, if I told you that a particular real-valued function was continuous on the interval <m>[0,1]</m>, and <m>f(0) = -1</m> and <m>f(1) = 5</m>, can we conclude that there is some point between <m>[0,1]</m> where the graph of the function crosses the <m>x</m>-axis? Yes, we can, thanks to the Intermediate Value Theorem from calculus. Can we conclude that there is exactly one point? No. Whenever we find an <q>answer</q> in math, we really have a (perhaps hidden) argument.

      Mathematics is really about establishing general statements (like the Intermediate Value Theorem).  This is done via an argument called a proof. We start with some given conditions, the <em>premises</em> of our argument, and from these, we find a consequence of interest, our <em>conclusion</em>.

    <p>
      The problem is, as you no doubt know from arguing with friends, not all arguments are <em>good</em> arguments. A bad argument is one in which the conclusion does not follow from the premises; i.e., the conclusion is not a consequence of the premises. Logic is the study of what makes an argument good or bad. In other words, logic aims to determine in which cases a conclusion is, or is not, a consequence of a set of premises.

      We will start in <xref ref="sec_logic-statements"/> by considering statements, the building blocks of arguments.  Understanding what counts as a statement and what form statements can take is the first step in understanding arguments. We will take a closer look at how statements can be combined in <xref ref="sec_logic-implications"/>.
      Then we will see what mathematical tools we can develop to better analyze these statements and how they interact in <xref ref="sec_logic-rules"/>.
    
      Finally, we will put all of this together in <xref ref="sec_logic-proofs"/> and <xref ref="sec_logic-structures"/> to see how we can use these tools to construct arguments and prove statements.
