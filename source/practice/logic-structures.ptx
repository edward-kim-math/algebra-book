    <statement>

        Given sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the <term>intersection</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, written <m>A \cap B</m>, is the set of all elements that are in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

        Suppose you wanted to prove that if <m>A \cap B = B</m> then <m>B \subseteq A</m>.

        Which would be a good start to this proof if you used a direct proof?
