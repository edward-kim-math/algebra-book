  <exercise label="parsons-comb-proof-basic">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Create a combinatorial proof of the identity <m>10+10 = 2\cdot 10</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <blocks>
      <block order="1">
        <choice correct="yes"><p>Consider the question, <q>How many two-digit numbers start with a 3 or 4?</q></p></choice>
        <choice><p>Consider the question, <q>How many 2-topping pizzas can you make choosing from 10 toppings?</q></p></choice>
      </block>
      <block order="2">
          <p>The first way to answer this is <m>10+10</m>.</p>
      </block>
      <block order="3">
        <choice correct="yes">
          <p>This is because there are 10 numbers that start with 3, and another 10 that start with 4.
          </p>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <p>This is because there are 10 choices for the first topping, and 10 choices for the second topping.
          </p>
        </choice>
      </block>
      <block order="5">
        <p>A second answer to the question is <m>2\cdot 10</m>.</p>
      </block>
      <block order="6">
        <choice correct="yes">
          <p>This is because you have 2 choices for the first digit, and 10 choices for the second digit.
          </p>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <p>This is because you must either choose 2 identical toppings or two different toppings.
          </p>
        </choice>
      </block>
      <block order="7">
       <p>Since both expressions answer the same question, they must be equal.  Therefore <m>10+10 = 2\cdot 10</m>.</p>

  <exercise label="rs-comb-proof-question">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If you were asked to give a combinatorial proof of the identity <m>\binom{n}{2}\binom{n-2}{k} = \binom{n}{k}\binom{n-k}{2}</m>, which of the following would be reasonable questions to use?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <choices randomize="yes" multiple-correct="yes">
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>
            How many ways can you select <m>2</m> flavors of ice cream from <m>n</m> choices and <m>k</m> toppings for your sundae?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>
            This is not going to be helpful, since when we switch from one side of the equation to the other, we will not be counting the same thing.  We need a question where the <m>k</m> things and the <m>2</m> things come from the same set of <m>n</m> things.

        <statement>
          <p>
            How many ways can you select <m>k</m> bow ties to pack in your checked bag and 2 more bow ties to pack in your carry-on, from a collection of <m>n</m> bow ties?

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>
            There are <m>n</m> students in Math Club.  How many ways can you pick a subset of size <m>2</m> or <m>k</m> that will run your fall fundraiser?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>
            If we wanted either <m>2</m> or <m>k</m> people, we would need to add the number of outcomes from each.

            From a class of <m>n</m> students, how many ways can you select 2 to be prefects and another <m>k</m> to be on the party planning committee?
