            An <em>anagram</em> of a word is a rearrangement of its letters
            (each of the letters must be used exactly once).
            We do not need the anagram to form an English word.
            
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  How many anagrams are there of the word <q>magic</q>?
                  Explain.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    <var name="$ans1" width="5"/>
                    </p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                <p>
                  How many anagrams are there of the word <q>abracadabra</q>?
                  Explain.
                  Note that you need to figure out how to deal with the repeated letters (starting with the first
                  <q>a</q> and then the second <q>a</q>
                  gives the same word as starting with the second <q>a</q>
                  and then the first <q>a</q>.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    <var name="$ans2" width="10"/>
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        A <em>sub-anagram</em> is just like an anagram except now you don't need to use all of the letters
                        (but you could).
                        So one sub-anagram of <q>magic</q> is <q>mac.</q>
                        How many sub-anagrams are there of the word <q>magic</q>?
                        Explain.
                        Hint: you might want to break this into cases.
                        </p>

                          </p>
                          </li>

                          <solution>
                            <p>
                              <ol>
                                <li>
                                  <p>
                                    There are <m>120 = 5!</m> anagrams.
                                    We can pick any of the 5 distinct letters to put first,
                                    then any of the remaining 4, and so on.
                                    We could also have written this <m>P(5,5)</m>.
                                    </p>
                                    </li>
                                    
                                    <li>
                                      <p>
                  We need to place 5 a's, 2 b's, 2 r's, and one each of c and d.
                  So first select 5 of the eleven slots for the a's, which can be done in <m>{11 \choose 5}</m> ways.
                  Then select 2 of the remaining 6 slots for b's, done in <m>{6 \choose 2}</m> ways.
                  Next pick 2 of the remaining 4 slots of r's, in <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> ways,
                  and finally pick one of the two available spots for the c leaving the last for the d.
                  Thus all together the number of anagrams is:
                  <me>
                    {11\choose 5}{6 \choose 2}{4 \choose 2}2\cdot 1 = 83160
                  </me>.
                  (Note, if you pick a different letter to start with,
                  you get a different looking answer,
                  but the final product should be the same.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Another approach: Think of all of the letters as different
                  (so there are 5 a's, but maybe written in 5 different fonts,
                  for example.)
                  In this case, there would be <m>11!</m> anagrams.
                  Now to correct for the repeated letters,
                  group all the anagrams that just have different arrangements of the a's, b's and r's into groups.
                  Each group would have <m>5!\cdot 2! \cdot 2!</m> different anagrams
                  (since there are <m>5!</m> ways to arrange the a's, <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the b's and <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the r's).
                  We just need to count groups, so the total is
                  <me>
                    \frac{11!}{5!2! 2!} = 83160
                    </me>.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        We already know there are 120 5-letter sub-anagrams.
                        To find the 4-letter sub-anagrams,
                        we need to pick one of 5 letters first, then one of remaining,
                        then one of 3 after that and one of the remaining 2.
                        Thus there are <m>5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 120</m> of these as well
                        (we could think of these as exactly the 120 full anagrams with the last letter missing).
                        There will be <m>5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60</m> 3-letter sub-anagrams,
                        <m>5\cdot 4 = 20</m> 2-letter sub-anagrams,
                        and <m>5</m> 1-letter sub-anagrams.
                        All together, this brings the number of sub-anagrams to
                        <me>
                    120 + 120 + 60 + 20 + 5 = 325
                    </me>.
