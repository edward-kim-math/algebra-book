      Suppose you are trying to prove, by strong induction, that a statement <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.  What would you attempt to prove in the <em>induction step</em> of the proof?  (Select all that apply.)

<exercise label="parsons-strong-induction-chocolate">
  <statement>
    <p>
      A simpler version of the chocolate bar problem is as follows:  Suppose you have a chocolate bar that is <m>n</m> squares long.  You can break the chocolate bar into two pieces by making a single straight break across the bar.  No matter where you make the breaks, you will break the chocolate bar into <m>n</m> pieces by making <m>n-1</m> breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrange some of the following statements in the correct order to form a proof of this claim by strong induction.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <blocks>
    <block order="5">
      <p>
        Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement that a chocolate bar that is <m>n</m> squares long can be broken into <m>n</m> pieces by making <m>n-1</m> breaks.
      </p>
    </block>
    <block order="3">
      <p>
        <m>P(1)</m> is true because a chocolate bar that is 1 square long is already in one piece.
      </p>
    </block>
    <block order="1">
      <p>
        Assume that <m>P(j)</m> is true for all <m>j \le k</m> for an arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>.
      </p>
    </block>
    <block order="4">
      <p>
        Consider a chocolate bar that is <m>k+1</m> squares long.
      </p>
      </block>
      <block order="6">
        <p>
          Anywhere you break this bar will result in two smaller bars, say of length <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. 
        </p>
      </block>
      <block order="8">
        <p>
          Since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are no more than <m>k</m>, it will be possible to break these smaller bars into single squares using <m>a-1</m> and <m>b-1</m> breaks, respectively.
        </p>
      </block>
      <block order="7">
        <p>
          The total number of breaks is therefore <m>a-1 + b-1 + 1 = a+b -1</m>, which is <m>k+1-1 = k</m>.
        </p>
      </block>
      <block order="2">
        <p>
          Therefore, by the principle of strong induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
