  <exercise>
    <idx><h>football (American)</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose a football team only scores 3-point field goals and 7-point touchdowns
        (ignore the possibilities of safeties,
        missed extra points, and two-point conversions).
        Prove, using <em>strong</em> induction, that the team can get any number of points, 12 points or greater. 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        If you have three base cases, can you always be sure you can get three points more?

  <exercise>
    <idx><h>interior angles</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove using <em>strong</em> induction that the sum of the interior angles of a convex <m>n</m>-gon is
        <m>(n-2)\cdot 180^\circ</m>. (A convex <m>n</m>-gon is a polygon with <m>n</m> sides for which each interior angle is less than <m>180^\circ</m>.)
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Start with a <m>(k+1)</m>-gon, and divide it into two smaller polygons.
      </p>

  <exercise>
    <idx><h>binary representation</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that every positive integer is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The proof will be by strong induction.
      </p>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement,
          <q><m>n</m> is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2.</q>
          We will show that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Base case: <m>1 = 2^0</m> is a power of 2, so <m>P(1)</m> is true.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inductive case: Suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true for all <m>k \lt n</m>.
          Now if <m>n</m> is a power of 2, we are done.
          If not, let <m>2^x</m> be the largest power of 2 strictly less than <m>n</m>.
          Consider <m>n - 2^x</m>,
          which is a smaller number, in fact smaller than both <m>n</m> and <m>2^x</m>.
          Thus <m>n-2^x</m> is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2, but none of them are going to be <m>2^x</m>,
          so together with <m>2^x</m> we have written <m>n</m> as the sum of distinct powers of 2.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, by the principle of (strong) mathematical induction,
          <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>

    </solution>

  <exercise>
    <idx><h>Fibonacci sequence</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove, using strong induction,
        that every natural number is either a Fibonacci number or can be written as the <em>sum</em>
        of <em>distinct</em> Fibonacci numbers.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        As with the previous question, we will want to subtract something from <m>n</m> in the inductive step.  There we subtracted the largest power of 2 less than <m>n</m>.  So what should you subtract here?
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you will still need to take care here that the sum you get from the inductive hypothesis, together with the number you subtracted, will be a sum of <em>distinct</em> Fibonacci numbers.  In fact, you could prove that the Fibonacci numbers in the sum are non-consecutive!
      </p>
    </hint>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We have previously proved that for any tree, the number of edges is always one less than the number of vertices.  That is, a tree with <m>v</m> vertices and <m>e</m> edges satisfies <m>v = e+1</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Give an alternate proof of this fact using strong induction on the number of vertices.  Do so by taking a non-leaf vertex and <q>splitting</q> it into two vertices, each belonging to a separate tree.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>


  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that a particular real number <m>x</m> has the property that <m>x + \frac{1}{x}</m> is an integer.
        Prove that <m>x^n + \frac{1}{x^n}</m> is an integer for all natural numbers <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You will need to use strong induction.
        For the inductive case, try multiplying <m>\left (x^k + \frac{1}{x^{k}}\right)\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right)</m>, and collect which terms together are integers.
      </p>

    <!-- This is a nice problem, to include here, as an example, or save for homework.  It requires some double induction.-->
  <exercise>
    <idx><h>double induction</h><see>induction, double</see></idx>
    <idx><h>induction</h><h>double</h></idx>
    <idx><h>Fibonacci sequence</h><h>identity</h></idx>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Here is an example of a more complicated induction technique called
        <term>double induction</term>.
      </p>
      
        <p>
          You will prove that the Fibonacci numbers satisfy the identity <m>F_n^2 + F_{n+1}^2 = F_{2n+1}</m>.
          One way to do this is to prove the more general identity,
          <me>
            F_mF_n + F_{m+1}F_{n+1} = F_{m+n+1}
          </me>,
          and realize that when <m>m = n</m> we get our desired result.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Note that we now have two variables,
          so we want to prove this for all <m>m \ge 0</m> <em>and</em>
          all <m>n \ge 0</m> at the same time.
          For each such pair <m>(m,n)</m>,
          let <m>P(m,n)</m> be the statement <m>F_mF_n + F_{m+1}F_{n+1} = F_{m+n+1}</m>
        </p>
        </introduction>
          
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              First fix <m>m = 0</m>, and give a proof by mathematical induction that <m>P(0,n)</m> holds for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.
              Note that this proof will be very easy.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </task>

          <task>
            <statement>
            <p>
              Now fix an arbitrary <m>n</m>, and give a proof by <em>strong</em>
              mathematical induction that <m>P(m,n)</m> holds for all <m>m \ge 0</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </task>

          <task>
            <statement>
            <p>
              You can now conclude that <m>P(m,n)</m> holds for all <m>m,n\ge 0</m>.
              Do you believe that?
              Explain why this sort of induction is valid.
              For example,
              why do your proofs above guarantee that <m>P(2,3)</m> is true?
            </p>
          </statement>
          </task>
  </exercise>
<!-- The previous problem can be done with simultaneous induction, which could also make a nice problem -->
<!-- Maybe one more double induction problem, without the scafolding? -->
  <exercise>
    <idx><h>puzzle</h><h>square division</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given a square,
        you can cut the square into smaller squares by cutting along lines parallel to the sides of the original square
        (these lines do not need to travel the entire side length of the original square).
        For example, by cutting along the lines below,
        you will divide a square into 6 smaller squares:
      </p>

      <sidebyside width="35%">

        <image>

        <latex-image>
          \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.75]
          \draw (0,0) rectangle (3,3) (0,0) rectangle (2,2) (1,2) -- (1,3) (2,2) -- (2,3) (2,2) -- (3,2) (2,1)-- (3,1);
          \end{tikzpicture}
        </latex-image>
        <description>One large square with five squares of half the side length wrapping around the top and right side, forming an even larger square.</description>
        </image>

      </sidebyside>

      <p>
        Prove, using strong induction,
        that it is possible to cut a square into <m>n</m> smaller squares for any <m>n \ge 6</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You will need three base cases.  This is a very good hint actually, as it suggests that to prove <m>P(n)</m> is true, you would want to use the fact that <m>P(n-3)</m> is true.  So somehow you need to increase the number of squares by 3.
