  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Is it possible for a planar graph to have 6 vertices, 10 edges, and 5 faces?
        Explain.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No.
        A (connected) planar graph must satisfy Euler's formula:
        <m>v - e + f = 2</m>.
        Here <m>v - e + f = 6 - 10 + 5 = 1</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The graph <m>G</m> has 6 vertices with degrees <m>2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5</m>.
        How many edges does <m>G</m> have?
        Could <m>G</m> be planar?
        If so, how many faces would it have?
        If not, explain.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>G</m> has 10 edges, since <m>10 = \frac{2+2+3+4+4+5}{2}</m>.
        It could be planar,
        and then it would have 6 faces, using Euler's formula:
        <m>6-10+f = 2</m> means <m>f = 6</m>.
        To make sure that it is actually planar though,
        we would need to draw a graph with those vertex degrees without edges crossing.
        This can be done by trial and error
        (and is possible).
      </p>

        Is it possible for a graph with 10 vertices and edges to be a connected planar graph?  Explain.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Is there a connected planar graph with an odd number of faces where every vertex has degree 6?  Prove your answer.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You can use the handshake lemma to find the number of edges, in terms of <m>v</m>, the number of vertices.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        I'm thinking of a polyhedron containing 12 faces.
        Seven are triangles and four are quadrilaterals.
        The polyhedron has 11 vertices including those around the mystery face.
        How many sides does the last face have?
      </p>
    </statement>
<!-- I should check that this is actually possible as a polyhedron -->
    <solution>
      <p>
        Say the last polyhedron has <m>n</m> edges
        and also <m>n</m> vertices.
        The total number of edges the polyhedron has then is <m>(7 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 4 + n)/2 = (37 + n)/2</m>.
        In particular,
        we know the last face must have an odd number of edges.
        We also have that <m> v = 11 </m>.
        By Euler's formula, we have <m>11 - (37+n)/2 + 12 = 2</m>,
        and solving for <m>n</m> we get <m>n = 5</m>,
        so the last face is a pentagon.
      </p>

        Consider some classic polyhedrons.

            <p>
              An <em>octahedron</em> is a regular polyhedron made up of 8 equilateral triangles
              (it sort of looks like two pyramids with their bases glued together).
              Draw a planar graph representation of an octahedron.
              How many vertices, edges, and faces does an octahedron
              (and your graph)
              have?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The traditional design of a soccer ball is a
              (spherical projection of a)
              truncated icosahedron.
              This consists of 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons.
              No two pentagons are adjacent
              (so the edges of each pentagon are shared only by hexagons).
              How many vertices,
              edges, and faces does a truncated icosahedron have?
              Explain how you arrived at your answers.
              Bonus: draw the planar graph representation of the truncated icosahedron.

              Your <q>friend</q> claims that he has constructed a convex polyhedron out of 2 triangles, 2 squares, 6 pentagons, and 5 octagons.
              Prove that your friend is lying.
              Hint: each vertex of a convex polyhedron must border at least three faces.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove Euler's formula using a minimal criminal argument, where minimum means smallest number of edges
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose there is a graph <m>G</m> with fewest edges that does not satisfy Euler's formula. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
			       Note that <m>G</m> cannot be a tree, since for any tree, <m>v = e+1</m> and <m>f = 1</m>, so <m>v - e + f = 2</m>.  Therefore, <m>G</m> must contain a cycle.  Pick any edge <m>e_0</m> that is part of a cycle in <m>G</m> and consider the graph <m>G' = G-e_0</m> that you get by removing just the edge <m>e_0</m> from <m>G</m>.
        </p>
    
       <p>
        Since <m>G'</m> has fewer edges than <m>G</m>, it must satisfy Euler's formula.  That is, <m>v' - e' + f' = 2</m>, where <m>v'</m>, <m>e'</m>, and <m>f'</m> are the number of vertices, edges, and faces of <m>G'</m>.  Since <m>G'</m> is obtained by removing a single edge from a cycle in <m>G</m>, we have <m>v' = v</m>, <m>e'=e-1</m>, and <m>f' = f-1</m>.  Therefore, <m>v - (e-1) + (f-1) = 2</m>, so <m>v - e + f = 2</m> as well.  This is a contradiction, so no such graph <m>G</m> can exist.

        Euler's formula (<m>v - e + f = 2</m>) holds for all
        <em>connected</em> planar graphs.
        What if a graph is not connected?
        Suppose a planar graph has two components.
        What is the value of <m>v - e + f</m> now?
        What if it has <m>k</m> components?

          A drawing of the Petersen graph: ten vertices arranged as a larger pentagon around a smaller pentagram (five pointed star).  Edges form the outside of the larger pentagon and the crossing lines of the pentagram. Each vertex of the larger pentagon is adjacent to the closest vertex of the inside pentagram.

        Prove that any planar graph with <m>v</m> vertices and <m>e</m> edges satisfies <m>e \le 3v - 6</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

      <proof>
        <p>
          We know in any planar graph the number of faces <m>f</m> satisfies
          <m>3f \le 2e</m> since each face is bounded by at least three edges,
          but each edge borders two faces.
          Combine this with Euler's formula:
          <me>
            v - e + f = 2
          </me>
          <me>
            v - e + \frac{2e}{3} \ge 2
          </me>
          <me>
            3v - e \ge 6
          </me>
          <me>
            3v - 6 \ge e
          </me>.
