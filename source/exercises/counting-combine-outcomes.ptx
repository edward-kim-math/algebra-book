    <statement>
      <p>
        Your Blu-ray collection consists of 9 comedies and 7 horror movies.
        Give an example of a question for which the answer is:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              16.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              63.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              For example, 16 is the number of choices you have if you want to watch one movie,
              either a comedy or horror flick.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For example, 63 is the number of choices you have if you will watch two movies,
              first a comedy and then a horror movie.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </solution>

    <statement>
      <p>
        The number 735000 factors as <m>2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7^2</m>.
        How many divisors does it have?
        Explain your answer using the multiplicative principle.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        For a simpler example, there are 4 divisors of <m>6 = 2\cdot 3</m>.  They are <m>1 = 2^0\cdot 3^0</m>, <m>2 = 2^1\cdot 3^0</m>, <m>3 = 2^0\cdot 3^1</m>, and <m>6 = 2^1\cdot 3^1</m>.
      </p>
