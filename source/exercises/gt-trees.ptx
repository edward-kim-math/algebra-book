      Which of the following graphs are trees?

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            This is not a tree since it contains a cycle.
            Note also that there are too many edges to be a tree, since we know that all trees with <m>v</m> vertices have <m>v-1</m> edges.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            This is a tree since it is connected and contains no cycles (which you can see by drawing the graph).
            All paths are trees.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            This is a tree since it is connected and contains no cycles (draw the graph).
            All stars are trees.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            This is a not a tree since it is not connected.
            Note that there are not enough edges to be a tree.

<exercise xml:id="ex-tree-deg-seq">
  <statement>
    <p>
      For each degree sequence below, decide whether it must always, must never, or could possibly be a degree sequence for a tree.
      Remember, a degree sequence lists out the degrees (number of edges incident to the vertex) of all the vertices in a graph in non-increasing order.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m> (4,1,1,1,1)</m>
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>(3,3,2,1,1)</m>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m> (2,2,2,1,1)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>(4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            This must be the degree sequence for a tree.
            This is because the vertex of degree 4 must be adjacent to the four vertices of degree 1 (there are no other vertices for it to be adjacent to), and thus we get a star.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            This cannot be a tree.
            Each degree 3 vertex is adjacent to all but one of the vertices in the graph.
            Thus each must be adjacent to one of the degree 1 vertices (and not the other).
            That means both degree 3 vertices are adjacent to the degree 2 vertex and to each other, so that means there is a cycle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alternatively, count how many edges there are!
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            This might or might not be a tree.
            The length 4 path has this degree sequence (this is a tree), but so does the union of a 3-cycle and a length 1 path (which is not connected, so this is not a tree).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            This cannot be a tree.
            The sum of the degrees is 28, so there are 14 edges.
            But there are 14 vertices as well, so we don't have <m>v = e+1</m>, meaning this cannot be a tree.

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose you have a graph with <m>v</m> vertices and <m>e</m> edges that satisfies <m>v = e+1</m>.
      Must the graph be a tree? Prove your answer.
    </p>

      Try <xref ref="ex-tree-deg-seq" />.

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Prove that any graph (not necessarily a tree) with <m>v</m> vertices and <m>e</m> edges that satisfies <m>v \gt e+1</m> will NOT be connected.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <hint>
    <p>
      Try a proof by contradiction, and consider a spanning tree of the graph.

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      If a graph <m>G</m> with <m>v</m> vertices and <m>e</m> edges is connected and has <m>v \lt e+1</m>, must it contain a cycle? Prove your answer.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      Yes.
      We will prove the contrapositive.
      Assume <m>G</m> does not contain a cycle.
      Then <m>G</m> is a tree, so this would have <m>v = e+1</m>, contrary to stipulation.

<exercise xml:id="ex-forest">
  <statement>
    <p>
      We define a <term>forest</term> to be a graph with no cycles.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Explain why this is a good name.
            That is, explain why a forest is a union of trees.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>F</m> is a forest consisting of <m>m</m> trees and <m>v</m> vertices.
            How many edges does <m> F</m> have? Explain.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Prove that any graph <m>G</m> with <m>v</m> vertices and <m> e</m> edges that satisfies <m>v \lt e+1</m> must contain a cycle (i.e., not be a forest).

      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>

  <hint>
    <p>
      For part (b), trying some simple examples should give you the formula.
      Then you just need to prove it is correct.

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Give a careful proof of <xref ref="cor-unique-paths-forests" />: A graph is a forest if and only if there is at most one path between any pair of vertices.
      Use proof by contrapositive (and not a proof by contradiction) for both directions.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <hint>
    <p>
      Examining the proof of <xref ref="prop-unique-paths-trees" /> gives you most of what you need, but make sure to just give the relevant parts, and take care to not use proof by contradiction.

      Give a careful <em>minimal criminal</em> proof that every tree is bipartite.

  <hint>

      Minimality here should be in terms of the number of vertices.
      If you had a minimum counterexample and removed a leaf vertex, the resulting graph will be a smaller tree, so...

            No, although there are graphs for which this is true.
            For example, <m>K_4</m> has a spanning tree that is a path (of three edges) and also a spanning tree that is a star (with center vertex of degree 3).

            Yes.
            For a fixed graph, we have a fixed number <m>v</m> of vertices.
            Any spanning tree of the graph will also have <m>v</m> vertices, and since it is a tree, must have <m>v-1</m> edges.

            No, although there are graphs for which this is true (note that if all spanning trees are isomorphic, then all spanning trees will have the same number of leaves).
            Again, <m>K_4</m> is a counterexample.
            One spanning tree is a path, with only two leaves, and another spanning tree is a star with 3 leaves.
