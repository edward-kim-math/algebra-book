  <idx><h>handshakes</h><h>connection to graphs</h> </idx>
  <statement>
    <p>
      If 10 people each shake hands with each other, how many handshakes took place? What does this question have to do with graph theory?
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      This is asking for the number of edges in <m>K_{10}</m>.
      Each vertex (person) has degree (shook hands with) 9 (people).
      So the sum of the degrees is <m>90</m>.
      However, the degrees count each edge (handshake) twice, so there are 45 edges in the graph.
      That is how many handshakes took place.
    </p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Among a group of 5 people, is it possible for everyone to be friends with exactly 2 of the people in the group? What about 3 of the people in the group?
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      It is possible for everyone to be friends with exactly 2 people.
      You could arrange the 5 people in a circle and say that everyone is friends with the two people on either side of them (so you get the graph <m>C_5</m>).
      However, it is not possible for everyone to be friends with 3 people.
      That would lead to a graph with an odd number of odd degree vertices which is impossible since the sum of the degrees must be even.
    </p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Is it possible for two <em>different</em> (non-isomorphic) graphs to have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges? What if the degrees of the vertices in the two graphs are the same (so both graphs have vertices with degrees 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4, for example)? Draw two such graphs or explain why not.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <hint>
    <p>
      Both situations are possible.
      Go find some examples.

        <description>
          A graph with five vertices arranged in a pentagon, labeled a through e, starting with the vertex at the top and proceeding counterclockwise.
          Edges between vertices a, c, and d make a triangle.
          Edges between b, c, d, and e form a quadralateral.
        </description>
      </image>
    </sidebyside>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      The graphs are not equal.
      For example, graph 1 has an edge <m>\{a,b\}</m>, but graph 2 does not have that edge.
      They are isomorphic.
      One possible isomorphism is <m>f:G_1 \to G_2</m> defined by <m>f(a) = d</m>, <m>f(b) = c</m>, <m>f(c) = e</m>, <m>f(d) = b</m>, <m>f(e) = a</m>.

      What is the largest number of edges possible in a graph with 10 vertices? What is the largest number of edges possible in a <em>bipartite</em> graph with 10 vertices? What is the largest number of edges possible in a <em>tree</em> with 10 vertices?

      The bipartite graph is a little tricky.

      We often define graph theory concepts using set theory.
      For example, given a graph <m>G = (V, E)</m> and a vertex <m>v \in V</m>, we define
      <me>
        N(v) = \{u \in V \st \{v,u\} \in E\}
      </me>.
      We define <m>N[v] = N(v) \cup \{v\}</m>.
      The goal of this problem is to figure out what all this means.

      A graph is a way of representing the relationships between elements in a set: An edge between the vertices <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> tells us that <m>x</m> is related to <m>y</m> (which we can write as <m>x \sim y</m>).
      Not all sorts of relationships can be represented by a graph, though.
      For each relationship described below, either draw the graph or explain why the relationship cannot be represented by a graph.
