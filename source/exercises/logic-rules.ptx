      <statement>
      <p>
        You stumble upon two trolls playing Stratego<registered />. They tell you: </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Troll 1: If we are cousins, then we are both knaves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Troll 2: We are cousins, or we are both knaves.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Could both trolls be knights?
        Recall that all trolls are either always-truth-telling knights or always-lying knaves.  Explain your answer and how you can use truth tables to find it.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You could probably reason through the cases by hand, but try making a truth table.  Use two statements, <m>P</m> being <q>we are cousins</q> and <m>Q</m> being <q>we are both knaves</q>.  
      </p>
    </hint>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Next you come upon three trolls, helpfully wearing name tags.
          They say:
          <dl width="narrow">
          <li>
            <title>Pat</title>
            <p>
              If either Quinn or I are knights, then so is Ryan.
            </p>
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <title>Quinn</title>
            <p>
              Ryan is a knight, and if Pat is a knight, then so am I.
            </p>
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <title>Ryan</title>
            <p>
              Quinn is a knave, but Pat and I share the same persuasion.
            </p>
          </li>
          </dl>
          Create a truth table that includes all three statements.  Then use the truth table to determine the persuasion of each troll.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p> Consider the statement about a party, <q>If it's your birthday or there will be cake,
          then there will be cake.</q>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p> Translate the above statement into symbols. Clearly state
        which statement is <m>P</m> and which is <m>Q</m>. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Make a truth table for the statement.

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
        Assuming the statement is true, what
              (if anything)
              can you conclude if you know there will be cake?
            </p>

            <p>
        Assuming the statement is true, what

              can you conclude if you know there will not be cake?

            <m>
            P</m>: It's your birthday; <m>Q</m>: There will be cake. <m>(P \vee Q) \imp Q</m>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Geoff Poshingten is out at a fancy pizza joint and decides to order a calzone. When the
        waiter asks what he would like in it, he replies, <q>I want either pepperoni or sausage.
          Also, if I have sausage, then I must also include quail.
          Oh, and if I have pepperoni or quail, then I must also have ricotta cheese.</q>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Translate Geoff's order into logical symbols.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
        The waiter knows that Geoff is either a liar or a truth-teller
              (so either everything he says is false, or everything is true).
              Which is it?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
        What, if anything,
              can the waiter conclude about the ingredients in Geoff's desired calzone?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You should write down three statements using the symbols <m>P, Q, R, S</m>. If Geoff is a
        truth-teller, then all three statements would be true. If he was a liar, then all three
        statements would be false. But in either case, we don't yet know whether the four atomic
        statements are true or false, since he hasn't said them by themselves. </p>
      
      <p>
        A truth table might help, although it is probably not entirely necessary.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine whether the following two statements are logically equivalent: <m>\neg(P \imp Q)</m>
        and <m>P \wedge \neg Q</m>. Explain how you know you are correct. </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Make a truth table for each and compare.
        The statements are logically equivalent.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>


  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Simplify the following statements (so that negation only appears right before variables). <ol>
          <li><m>\neg(P
        \imp \neg Q)</m>.</li>

          <li>
            <m>(\neg P \vee
              \neg Q) \imp \neg (\neg Q \wedge R)</m>. </li>

          <li>
            <m>\neg((P \imp \neg Q) \vee \neg (R \wedge
        \neg
              R))</m>. </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              It is false that if Sam is not a man then Chris is a woman,
              and that Chris is not a woman.
            </p>
          </li>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><m>P
            \wedge Q</m>.</li>

          <li>
            <m>(\neg P \vee \neg R) \imp (Q \vee \neg R)</m> or, replacing the
            implication with a disjunction first: <m>(P \wedge Q) \vee (Q \vee \neg R)</m>. </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(P
              \wedge Q) \wedge (R \wedge \neg R)</m>. This is necessarily false, so it is also
              equivalent to <m>P \wedge \neg P</m>. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Either Sam is a woman and Chris is a man, or Chris is a woman.
            </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Use De Morgan's Laws and any other logical equivalence facts you know to simplify the
        following statements. Show all your steps. Your final statements should have negations only
        appear directly next to the sentence variables or predicates (<m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, <m>E(x)</m>, etc.),
        and no double negations. It would be a good idea to use only conjunctions, disjunctions, and
        negations. <ol>
          <li>
            <m>\neg((\neg P \wedge Q) \vee \neg(R \vee \neg S))</m>. </li>

          <li>
            <m>\neg((\neg P \imp \neg
        Q) \wedge (\neg Q \imp R))</m> (careful with the implications). </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For both parts above,
              verify your answers are correct using truth tables.
              That is, use a truth table to check that the given statement and your proposed
        simplification are actually logically equivalent.

          <li>
            <p> Make a

          <li>
            <p> If you
        believed the statement was <em>false</em>, what properties would a counterexample need to
        possess? Explain by referencing your truth table. </p>

              If the statement were true,

              Again, explain using the truth table.

          <li>
            <p>
              Consider the three rows that evaluate to false, and say what the truth values of <m>T</m>, <m>

          <li>

    <statement>

        Tommy Flanagan was telling you what he ate yesterday afternoon. He tells you, <q>I had either
        popcorn or raisins.
          Also, if I had cucumber sandwiches, then I had soda.
          But I didn't drink soda or tea.</q> Of course, you know that Tommy is the world's worst
        liar, and everything he says is false. What did Tommy eat? </p>

      <p> Justify your answer by
        writing all of Tommy's statements using sentence variables (<m>P, Q, R, S, T</m>), taking their
        negations, and using these to deduce what Tommy actually ate. </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p> Write
        down three statements, and then take the negation of each (since he is a liar). You should
        find that Tommy ate one item and drank one item. (<m>Q</m> is for cucumber sandwiches.) </p>

        Simplifying negations will be especially useful when we try to prove a
        statement by considering what would happen if it were false. For each statement below, write

        It might help to translate the statements into symbols and then use the formulaic rules to
        simplify negations (i.e., rules for quantifiers and De Morgan's laws). After simplifying,
        you should get <m>\forall x(\neg E(x) \wedge \neg O(x))</m> for the first one, for example.
        Then translate this back into English. </p>

        We can simplify statements in predicate logic using our rules for passing negations
        over quantifiers before applying logical equivalence to the <q>inside</q>
        propositional part. Simplify the statements below (so negation appears only directly next to
        predicates). <ol>
          <li>
            <m>\neg \exists x \forall y (\neg O(x) \vee E(y))</m>. </li>

          <li>
            <m>\neg \forall x \neg
        \forall y \neg(x \lt y \wedge \exists z (x \lt z \vee y \lt z))</m>. </li>

          <li>
            <p> There is a number <m>
        n</m> for which no other number is less than or equal to <m>n</m>. </p>

        It is false that for every number <m>n</m> there are two other numbers which <m>n</m> is between. </p>
