    <statement>
      
      <p> For a given predicate <m>P(x)</m>, you might believe that the statements <m>\forall x P(x)</m> or <m>\exists x P(x)</m> are either true or false. How would you decide if you were correct in each case? You have four choices: You could give an example of an element <m>n</m> in the domain for which <m>P(n)</m> is true or for which <m>P(n)</m> is false, or you could argue that no matter what <m>n</m> is, <m>P(n)</m> is true or is false. <ol>
          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true? </p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is false? </p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\exists x P(x)</m> is true? </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> What would you need to do to prove <m>\exists x P(x)</m> is false? </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p> The claim that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> means that <m>P(n)</m> is true no matter what <m>n</m> you consider in the domain of discourse. Thus the only way to prove that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true is to check or otherwise argue that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n</m> in the domain. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> To prove <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is false all you need is one example of an element in the domain for which <m>P(n)</m> is false. This is often called a <term>counterexample</term>. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> We are simply claiming that there is some element <m>n</m> in the domain of discourse for which <m>P(n)</m> is true. If you can find one such element, you have verified the claim. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Here we are claiming that no element we find will make <m>P(n)</m> true. The only way to be sure of this is to verify that <em>every</em> element of the domain makes <m>P(n)</m> false. Note that the level of proof needed for this statement is the same as to prove that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true. </p>

          <li>

              False.
              For example, <m>a = 3</m> and <m>b = 5</m>. <m>a+b = 8</m>,

              Assume both are even.

              But then <m>a+b = 2k + 2j = 2(k+j)</m>, which is even.

              Proof by contradiction.
              Start of proof: Assume, for the sake of contradiction,
              that there are integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>x</m> is a prime greater than 5 and <m>x = 6y + 3</m>.
              End of proof:
              <ellipsis/> this is a contradiction,
              so there are no such integers.

              Direct proof.
              Start of proof: Let <m>n</m> be an integer.
              Assume <m>n</m> is a multiple of 3.
              End of proof: Therefore <m>n</m> can be written as the sum of consecutive integers.

              Proof by contrapositive.

              Assume that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are even.
              End of proof: Therefore <m>a^2 + b^2</m> is even.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>n</m> be an integer.
                  Assume <m>n</m> is even.
                  Then <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
                  Thus <m>8n = 16k = 2(8k)</m>.
                  Therefore <m>8n</m> is even.

              That is, there is an integer <m>n</m> such that <m>8n</m> is even but <m>n</m> is odd.
              For example, consider <m>n = 3</m>.
              Then <m>8n = 24</m> which is even, but <m>n = 3</m> is odd.

        The game TENZI comes with 40 six-sided dice
        (each numbered 1 to 6).
        Suppose you roll all 40 dice.

        <ol>

            Prove that there will be at least seven dice that land on the same number.

            <p>
              How many dice would you have to roll before you were guaranteed that some four of them would all match or all be different?
              Prove your answer.

              This is an example of the pigeonhole principle.
              We can prove it by contrapositive.
            </p>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Suppose that each number only came up 6 or fewer times.
                So there are at most six 1's, six 2's, and so on.
                That's a total of 36 dice, so you must not have rolled all 40 dice.
              </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              We can have 9 dice without any four matching or any four being all different:
              three 1's, three 2's, three 3's.
              We will prove that whenever you roll 10 dice,
              you will always get four matching or all being different.
            </p>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Suppose you roll 10 dice, but that there are NOT four matching rolls.
                This means that at most there are three of any given value.
                If we only had three different values,
                that would be only 9 dice,
                so there must be 4 different values,
                giving 4 dice that are all different.
              </p>

      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        A proof by contradiction would be reasonable here, because then you get to assume that both <m>a</m> <em>and</em> <m>b</m> are odd.  Deduce that <m>c^2</m> is even, and therefore a multiple of 4 (why? and why is that a contradiction?).

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime then <m>n</m> is solitary.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Write out the beginning and end of the argument if you were to prove the statement,

        <ol>

      <p>
        You do not need to provide the middle parts of the proofs
        (since you do not know what solitary means).
        However, make sure that you give the first few and last few lines of the proofs so that we can see the logical structure you would follow.

        Your <q>friend</q> has shown you a <q>proof</q>
        he wrote to show that <m>1 = 3</m>.
        Here is the proof:
      </p>

      <proof>
        <p>
          I claim that <m>1 = 3</m>.
          Of course we can do anything to one side of an equation as long as we also do it to the other side.
          So subtract 2 from both sides.
          This gives <m>-1 = 1</m>.
          Now square both sides, to get <m>1 = 1</m>.
          And we all agree this is true.
        </p>
      </proof>

      <p>
        What is going on here?
        Is your friend's argument valid?
        Is the argument a proof of the claim <m>1=3</m>?

      <p>
        A standard deck of 52 cards consists of 4 suits (hearts,
        diamonds,
        spades, and clubs) each containing 13 different values (Ace, 2, 3, <ellipsis/>, 10, J, Q, K).
        If you draw some number of cards at random, you might or might not have a pair
        (two cards with the same value)
        or three cards all of the same suit.
        However, if you draw enough cards,
        you will be guaranteed to have these.
        For each of the following,
        find the smallest number of cards you would need to draw to be guaranteed having the specified cards.
        Prove your answers.

        Your friend has given you his list of 115 best Doctor Who episodes
        (in order of greatness).
        It turns out that you have seen 60 of them.
        Prove that there are at least two episodes you have seen that are exactly four episodes apart on your friend's list.

      <p>
        This feels like the pigeonhole principle, although a bit more complicated.  At least, you could try to replicate the style of proof used by the pigeonhole principle.  How would the episodes need to be spaced out so that no two of your sixty were exactly 4 apart?
