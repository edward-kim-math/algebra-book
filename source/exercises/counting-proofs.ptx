    <statement>
      <p>
        Give a combinatorial proof of the identity <m>2+2+2 = 3\cdot 2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Question: How many 2-letter words start with <em>a</em>,
          <em>b</em>,
          or <em>c</em> and end with either
          <em>y</em> or <em>z</em>?
        </p>

        <p>
          Answer 1: There are two words that start with <em>a</em>,
          two that start with <em>b</em>,
          two that start with <em>c</em>,
          for a total of <m>2+2+2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Answer 2: There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for the second letter,
          for a total of <m>3 \cdot 2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the two answers are both answers to the same question,
          they are equal.
          Thus <m>2 + 2 + 2 = 3\cdot 2</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>

          Suppose you own <m>x</m> fezzes and <m>y</m> bow ties. Of course, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both greater than 1.

            Question: You have a large container filled with ping-pong balls,
            all with a different number on them.
            You must select <m>k</m> of the balls,
            putting two of them in a jar and the others in a box.
            How many ways can you do this?
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 1: First select 2 of the <m>n</m> balls to put in the jar.
            Then select <m>k-2</m> of the remaining <m>n-2</m> balls to put in the box.
            The first task can be completed in <m>{n \choose 2}</m> different ways and
            the second task in <m>{n-2 \choose k-2}</m> ways.
            Thus there are <m>{n \choose 2}{n-2 \choose k-2}</m> ways to select the balls.
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 2: First select <m>k</m> balls from the <m>n</m> in the container.
            Then pick 2 of the <m>k</m> balls you picked to put in the jar,
            placing the remaining <m>k-2</m> in the box.
            The first task can be completed in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways and
            the second task in <m>{k \choose 2}</m> ways.
            Thus there are <m>{n \choose k}{k \choose 2}</m> ways to select the balls.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since both answers count the same thing,
            they must be equal, and the identity is established.

        Establish the identity below using a combinatorial proof.
        <me>
          {2 \choose 2}{n \choose 2} + {3 \choose 2}{n-1 \choose 2} + {4\choose 2}{n-2 \choose 2} + \cdots + {n\choose 2}{2\choose 2} = {n+3 \choose 5}

    <statement>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="ex-comb-proof-rowsum"/> we established that the sum of any row in Pascal's triangle is a power of two.  Specifically,
        <me>
          {n\choose 0} + {n \choose 1} + {n\choose 2} + \cdots + {n \choose n} = 2^n
        </me>.
        The argument given there used the counting question, <q>How many pizzas can you build using any number of <m>n</m> different toppings?</q>  To practice, give new proofs of this identity using different questions.

        For the lattice paths, think about what sort of paths <m>2^n</m> would count.  Not all the paths will end at the same point, but you could describe the set of end points as a line.
