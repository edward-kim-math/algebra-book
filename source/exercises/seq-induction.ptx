  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        On the way to the market,
        you exchange your cow for some magic dark chocolate espresso beans.
        These beans have the property that every night at midnight,
        each bean splits into two, effectively doubling your collection.
        You decide to take advantage of this, and each morning (around 8 am) you eat 5 beans.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Explain why it is true that <em>if</em>
              at noon on day <m>n</m> you have a number of beans ending in a 5, then at noon on day <m>n+1</m> you will still have a number of beans ending in a 5.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Why is the previous fact not enough to conclude that you will always have a number of beans ending in a 5?
              What additional fact would you need?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Assuming you have the additional fact in part (b),
              and have successfully proved the fact in part (a),
              how do you know that you will always have a number of beans ending in a 5?
              Illustrate what is going on by carefully explaining how the two facts above prove that you will have a number of beans ending in a 5 on
              <em>day 4</em> specifically.
              In other words, explain why induction works in this context.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If we have a number of beans ending in a 5, and we double it,
              we will get a number of beans ending in a 0
              (since <m>5\cdot 2 = 10</m> ).
              Then if we subtract 5, we will once again get a number of beans ending in a 5.
              Thus, if on any day we have a number ending in a 5, the next day we will also have a number ending in a 5.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If you don't <em>start</em> with a number of beans ending in a 5
              (on day 1),
              the above reasoning is still correct but not helpful.
              For example,
              if you start with a number ending in a 3, the next day you will have a number ending in a 1.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Part (b) is the base case, and part (a) is the inductive case.
              If on day 1 we have a number ending in a 5 (by part (b)),
              then on day 2 we will also have a number ending in a 5 (by part (a)).
              Then by part (a) again, we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 3.
              By part (a) again,
              this means we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 4.
            </p>

            <p>
              The proof by induction would say that on <em>every</em>
              day we will have a number ending in a 5, and this works because we can start with the base case and
              then use the inductive case over and over until we get up to our desired <m>n</m>.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use induction to prove for all
        <m>n \in \N</m> that <m>\d\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

      <proof>
        <p>
          We must prove that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \cdots +2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
          Thus let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>.
          We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
          First we establish the base case,
          <m>P(0)</m>, which claims that <m>1 = 2^{0+1} -1</m>.
          Since <m>2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1</m>,
          we see that <m>P(0)</m> is true.
          Now for the inductive case.
          Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \in \N</m>.
          That is, <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1</m>.
          We must show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true (i.e., that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+2} - 1</m>).
          To do this, we start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:
          <md>
            <mrow>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k + 2^{k+1} = \amp ~ 2^{k+1} - 1 + 2^{k+1} \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis.}</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp ~2\cdot 2^{k+1} - 1 \amp</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp ~ 2^{k+2} - 1 \amp</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true, so by the principle of mathematical induction,
          <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
        </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that <m>7^n - 1</m> is a multiple of 6 for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement,
          <q><m>7^n - 1</m> is a multiple of 6.</q>
          We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
          First we establish the base case, <m>P(0)</m>.
          Since <m>7^0 - 1 = 0</m>,
          and <m>0</m> is a multiple of 6, <m>P(0)</m> is true.
          Now for the inductive case.
          Assume <m>P(k)</m> holds for an arbitrary <m>k \in \N</m>.
          That is, <m>7^k - 1</m> is a multiple of 6, or in other words,
          <m>7^k - 1 = 6j</m> for some integer <m>j</m>.
          Now consider <m>7^{k+1} - 1</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>7^{k+1} - 1 ~ \amp = 7^{k+1} - 7 + 6 \amp \text{by cleverness:} -1 = -7 + 6</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 7(7^k - 1) + 6 \amp \text{factor out a 7 from the first two terms}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 7(6j) + 6 \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 6(7j + 1) \amp \text{factor out a 6}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore <m>7^{k+1} - 1</m> is a multiple of 6, or in other words,
          <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
          Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction,
          <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2</m> for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1+3 +5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2</m>.
          We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
          First the base case, <m>P(1)</m>.
          We have <m>1 = 1^2</m> which is true,
          so <m>P(1)</m> is established.
          Now the inductive case.
          Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some fixed arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>.
          That is, <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) = k^2</m>.
          We will now prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is also true (i.e., that <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k+1) = (k+1)^2</m>).
          We start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:
          <md>
            <mrow>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) + (2k+1) ~ \amp = k^2 + (2k+1) \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = (k+1)^2 \amp \text{by factoring}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> holds,
          so by the principle of mathematical induction,
          <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that <m>F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2n} = F_{2n+1} - 1</m> where <m>F_n</m> is the <m>n</m>th Fibonacci number.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2n} = F_{2n+1} - 1</m>.
          We will show that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.
          First the base case is easy because <m>F_0 = 0</m> and <m>F_1 = 1</m> so <m>F_0 = F_1 - 1</m>.
          Now consider the inductive case.
          Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true, that is,
          assume <m>F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2k} = F_{2k+1} - 1</m>.
          To establish <m>P(k+1)</m> we work from left to right:
          <md>
            <mrow>F_0 + F_2 + \cdots + F_{2k} + F_{2k+2} ~ \amp = F_{2k+1} - 1 + F_{2k+2} \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis.}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = F_{2k+1} + F_{2k+2} - 1 \amp</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = F_{2k+3} - 1 \amp \text{by the recursive definition.}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore <m>F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2k+2} = F_{2k+3} - 1</m>,
          which is to say <m>P(k+1)</m> holds.
          Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction,
          <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that <m>2^n \lt n!</m> for all <m>n \ge 4</m>.
        (Recall, <m>n! = 1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots\cdot n</m>.)
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>2^n \lt  n!</m>.
          We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 4</m>.
          First, we check the base case and see that yes, <m>2^4 \lt  4!</m>
          (as <m>16 \lt  24</m>),
          so <m>P(4)</m> is true.
          Now for the inductive case.
          Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \ge 4</m>.
          That is, <m>2^k \lt  k!</m>.
          Now consider <m>P(k+1)</m>: <m>2^{k+1} \lt  (k+1)!</m>.
          To prove this,
          we start with the left side and work to the right side.
          <md>
            <mrow>2^{k+1}~ \amp = 2\cdot 2^k \amp</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \lt 2\cdot k! \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \lt (k+1) \cdot k! \amp \text{ since } k+1 \gt 2</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = (k+1)! \amp</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore <m>2^{k+1} \lt (k+1)!</m>, so we have established <m>P(k+1)</m>.
          Thus by the principle of mathematical induction <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 4</m>.

        What is wrong with the following
        <q>proof</q> of the <q>fact</q>
        that <m>n+3 = n+7</m> for all values of <m>n</m> (besides of course that the thing it is claiming to prove is false)?
      </p>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement that <m>n + 3 = n + 7</m>.
          We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
          Assume, for induction, that <m>P(k)</m> is true.
          That is, <m>k+3 = k+7</m>.
          We must show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
          Now since <m>k + 3 = k + 7</m>, add 1 to both sides.
          This gives <m>k + 3 + 1 = k + 7 + 1</m>.
          Regrouping <m>(k+1) + 3 = (k+1) + 7</m>.
          But this is simply <m>P(k+1)</m>.
          Thus by the principle of mathematical induction <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
        </p>

        The only problem is that we never established the base case.

    <statement>
      <p>
        The proof in the previous problem does not work.
        But if we modify the <q>fact,</q>
        we can get a working proof.
        Prove that <m>n + 3 \lt n + 7</m> for all values of <m>n \in \N</m>.
        You can do this proof with algebra
        (without induction),
        but the goal of this exercise is to write out a valid induction proof.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement that <m>n + 3 \lt n + 7</m>.
          We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
          First, note that the base case holds: <m>0+3 \lt 0+7</m>.
          Now assume for induction that <m>P(k)</m> is true.
          That is, <m>k+3 \lt k+7</m>.
          We must show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
          Now since <m>k + 3 \lt k + 7</m>, add 1 to both sides.
          This gives <m>k + 3 + 1 \lt k + 7 + 1</m>.

        Find the flaw in the following <q>proof</q> of the <q>fact</q>
        that <m>n \lt 100</m> for every <m>n \in \N</m>.
      </p>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>n \lt 100</m>.
          We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
          First we establish the base case:
          when <m>n = 0</m>, <m>P(n)</m> is true, because <m>0 \lt 100</m>.
          Now for the inductive step, assume <m>P(k)</m> is true.
          That is, <m>k \lt 100</m>.
          Now if <m>k \lt 100</m>, then <m>k</m> is some number, like 80.
          Of course <m>80+1 = 81</m> which is still less than 100.
          So <m>k +1 \lt 100</m> as well.
          But this is what <m>P(k+1)</m> claims,
          so we have shown that <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m>.
          Thus by the principle of mathematical induction,
          <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The problem here is that while <m>P(0)</m> is true,
        and while <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> for
        <em>some</em> values of <m>k</m>,
        there is at least one value of <m>k</m>
        (namely <m>k = 99</m>)
        when that implication fails.
        For a valid proof by induction,
        <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> must be true for all values of <m>k</m> greater than or equal to the base case.

        While the above proof does not work
        (it better not since the statement it is trying to prove is false!)
        we can prove something similar.
        Prove that there is a strictly increasing sequence <m>a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots</m> of numbers
        (not necessarily integers)

        For the inductive step, you can assume you have a strictly increasing sequence up to <m>a_k</m> where <m>a_k \lt 100</m>.  Now you just need to find the next term <m>a_{k+1}</m> so that <m>a_{k} \lt a_{k+1} \lt 100</m>.  What should <m>a_{k+1}</m> be?

        What is wrong with the following

        that for all <m>n \in \N</m>,
        the number <m>n^2 + n</m> is odd?
      </p>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement
          <q><m>n^2 + n</m> is odd.</q>
          We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
          Suppose, for induction, that <m>P(k)</m> is true,
          that is, that <m>k^2 + k</m> is odd.
          Now consider the statement <m>P(k+1)</m>.
          Now <m>(k+1)^2 + (k+1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 + k + 1 = k^2 + k + 2k + 2</m>.
          By the inductive hypothesis,
          <m>k^2 + k</m> is odd, and of course <m>2k + 2</m> is even.
          An odd plus an even is always odd,
          so therefore <m>(k+1)^2 + (k+1)</m> is odd.
          Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction,
          <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

        This is similar to <xref ref="exc-seq-lessthan-100"/>, although there you were showing that a sequence had all its terms less than some value, and here you are showing that the sum is less than some value.  But the partial sums forms a sequence, so this is actually very similar.

      <p>
        Use induction to prove that <m>\d\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} = 2^n</m>.
        That is, the sum of the <m>n</m>th row of Pascal's triangle is <m>2^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Here's the idea:
        Since every entry in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two entries above it,
        we can get the <m>k+1</m>st row by adding up all the pairs of entry from the <m>k</m>th row.
        But doing this uses each entry on the <m>k</m>th row twice.
        Thus each time we drop to the next row, we double the total.
        Of course, row 0 has sum <m>1 = 2^0</m>
        (the base case).
        Now try to make this precise with a formal induction proof.
        You will use the fact that
        <m>{n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}</m> for the inductive case.

        (This is an example of the hockey stick theorem.)
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        To see why this works, try it on a copy of Pascal's triangle.
        We are adding up the entries along a diagonal,
        starting with the 1 on the left-hand side of the 4th row.
        Suppose we add up the first 5 entries on this diagonal.
        The claim is that the sum is the entry below and to the left of the last of these 5 entries.
        Note that if this is true, and we instead add up the first 6 entries,
        we will need to add the entry one spot to the right of the previous sum.
        But these two together give the entry below them,
        which is below and left of the last of the 6 entries on the diagonal.
        If you follow that, you can see what is going on.
        But it is not a great proof.
        A formal induction proof is needed.

        Use the product rule for logarithms (<m>\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)</m>) to prove,
        by induction on <m>n</m>,
        that <m>\log(a^n) = n \log(a)</m>,
        for all natural numbers <m>n \ge 2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The idea here is that if we take the logarithm of <m>a^n</m>,
        we can increase <m>n</m> by 1 if we multiply by another <m>a</m>
        (inside the logarithm).
        This results in adding 1 more <m>\log(a)</m> to the total.
      </p>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>\log(a^n) = n \log(a)</m>.
          The base case, <m>P(2)</m> is true,
          because <m>\log(a^2) = \log(a\cdot a) = \log(a) + \log(a) = 2\log(a)</m>,
          by the product rule for logarithms.
          Now assume, for induction, that <m>P(k)</m> is true.
          That is, <m>\log(a^k) = k\log(a)</m>.
          Consider <m>\log(a^{k+1})</m>.
          We have
          <me>
            \log(a^{k+1}) = \log(a^k\cdot a) = \log(a^k) + \log(a) = k\log(a) + \log(a)
          </me>,
          with the last equality due to the inductive hypothesis.
          But this simplifies to <m>(k+1) \log(a)</m>,
          establishing <m>P(k+1)</m>.
          Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction,
          <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.
