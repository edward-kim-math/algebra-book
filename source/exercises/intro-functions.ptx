          There are 16 functions: you have a choice of four outputs for <m>f(1)</m>, and for each, you have four choices for the output <m>f(2)</m>. Of these functions, 12 are injective, 0 are surjective, and 0 are both (i.e., bijective):

        Suppose <m>f:\N \to \N</m> satisfies the recurrence relation <me>

        Note that with the initial condition <m>f(0) = 1</m>, the values of the function are: <m>f(1) = 4</m>

        in general. The <em>Collatz conjecture</em> is that no matter what the initial condition is, the

                Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be elements of the domain <m>\Z</m>. Assume <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. If <m>x</m>
                and <m>y</m> are both even, then <m>f(x) = x+1</m> and <m>f(y) = y+1</m>. Since <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>,
                we have <m>x + 1 = y + 1</m> which implies that <m>x = y</m>. Similarly, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
                are both odd, then <m>x - 3 = y-3</m> so again <m>x = y</m>. The only other possibility is
                that <m>x</m> is even and <m>y</m> is odd (or vice-versa). But then <m>x + 1</m> would be odd,
                and <m>y - 3</m> would be even, so it cannot be that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. Therefore if <m>f(x)
                = f(y)</m> we then have <m>x = y</m>, which proves that <m>f</m> is injective. </p>

                two cases: First, if <m>y</m> is even, then let <m>n = y+3</m>. Since <m>y</m> is even, <m>n</m>
                is odd, so <m>f(n) = n-3 = y+3-3 = y</m> as desired. Second, if <m>y</m> is odd, then let <m>n
                = y-1</m>. Since <m>y</m> is odd, <m>n</m> is even, so <m>f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y</m> as

      <p>
        In general, there is no relationship between <m>\card{B}</m> and <m>\card{f\inv(B)}</m>. This is
        because <m>B</m> might contain elements that are not in the range of <m>f</m>, so we might even
        have <m>f\inv(B) = \emptyset</m>. On the other hand, there might be lots of elements from the

      <p>
        More specifically, if <m>f</m> is injective, then <m>\card{B} \ge \card{f\inv(B)}</m> (since every
