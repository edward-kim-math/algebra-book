    <statement>
      <p>
        How many triangles are there with vertices from the points shown below?
        Note that we are not allowing degenerate triangles <ndash/> ones with all three vertices on the same
        line <ndash/>
        but we do allow non-right triangles.
        Explain why your answer is correct.
      </p>

            Five equally spaced dots in a vertical line and six additional equally spaced dots
            extending to the right in a horizontal line from the lowest dot (forming a right angle).

    <hint>
      <p>
        If you pick any three points, you can get a triangle, unless those three points are all on
        the <m>x</m>-axis or on the <m>y</m>-axis. There are other ways to start this as well, and any
        correct method should give the same answer. </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        We have seen that the formula for <m>P(n,k)</m> is <m>\dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m>. Your task here is to
        explain <em>why</em> this is the right formula. <ol>
          <li>
            <p> Suppose you have 12 chips, each a different
        color. How many different stacks of 5 chips can you make? Explain your answer and why it is
        the same as using the formula for <m>P(12,5)</m>. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Using the scenario of the
        12 chips again, what does <m>12!</m> count? What does <m>7!</m> count? Explain. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
        Explain why it makes sense to divide <m>12!</m> by <m>7!</m> when computing <m>P(12,5)</m> (in terms
        of the chips). </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Does your explanation work for numbers other than 12 and
        5? Explain the formula <m>P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m> using the variables <m>n</m> and <m>k</m>. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
