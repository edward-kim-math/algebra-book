  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the sequence <m>1, 3, 7, 13, 21, \ldots</m>.
        Explain how you know the closed formula for the sequence will be quadratic.
        Then <q>guess</q> the correct formula by comparing this sequence to the squares <m>1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots</m>
        (do not use polynomial fitting).
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>a_n = n^2 - n + 1</m>.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use a similar technique as in the previous exercise to find a closed formula for the sequence <m>2, 11, 34, 77, 146, 247,\ldots</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the sequence <m>2, 7, 15, 26, 40, 57, \ldots</m>
        (with <m>a_0 = 2</m>).
        By looking at the differences between terms,
        express the sequence as a sequence of partial sums.
        Then find a closed formula for the sequence by computing the <m>n</m>th partial sum.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We have <m>2 = 2</m>, <m>7 = 2+5</m>,
        <m>15 = 2 + 5 + 8</m>, <m>26 = 2+5+8+11</m>, and so on.
        The terms in the sums are given by the arithmetic sequence <m>b_n = 2+3n</m>.
        In other words, <m>a_n = \sum_{k=0}^n (2+3k)</m>.
        To find the closed formula, we reverse and add.
        We get <m>a_n = \frac{(4+3n)(n+1)}{2}</m>
        (we have <m>n+1</m> there because there are <m>n+1</m> terms in the sum for <m>a_n</m>).

        If you have enough toothpicks,
        you can make a large triangular grid.
        Below, are the triangular grids of size 1 and of size 2.
        The size 1 grid requires 3 toothpicks,
        the size 2 grid requires 9 toothpicks.

        The interesting thing here is that a

              Is the sequence arithmetic or geometric?
              If not, is it the sequence of partial sums of an arithmetic or geometric sequence?

    <statement>
      <p>
        Generalize <xref ref="ex-quad-diff" text="custom">Practice Problem 5</xref>: Find a closed formula for the sequence of differences of <m>a_n = an^2 + bn + c</m>.
        That is, prove that every quadratic sequence has arithmetic differences.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>a_{n-1} = a(n-1)^2 + b(n-1) + c = an^2 - 2an + a + bn - b + c</m>.
        Therefore <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 2an - a + b</m>, which is arithmetic.
        Notice that this is not quite the derivative of <m>a_n</m>,
        which would be <m>2an + b</m>, but it is close.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Can you use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47,
        <ellipsis/>?
        Explain why or why not.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No.
        The sequence of differences is the same as the original sequence, so no differences will be constant.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Will the <m>n</m>th sequence of differences of <m>2, 6, 18, 54, 162, \ldots</m> ever be constant?
        Explain.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No.
        The sequence is geometric, and in fact has closed formula <m>2\cdot 3^n</m>.
        This is an exponential function,
        which is not equal to any polynomial of any degree.
        If the <m>n</m>th sequence of differences was constant,
        then the closed formula for the original sequence would be a degree <m>n</m> polynomial.
