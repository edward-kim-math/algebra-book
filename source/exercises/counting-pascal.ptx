<exercise>
  <p>
    How many lattice paths are there from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(8,3)</m>.  How many lattice paths are there from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(3,8)</m>?  Why does it make sense that these two numbers are the same?  Explain your reasoning.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Suppose you are counting lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(4,3)</m>.  We know that the number of such paths is <m>\binom{4+3}{4} = \binom{7}{4} = 35</m>.  Here is another way to count these paths: Consider the cases for where your first step in the <m>y</m>-direction is.  There are five different options here; compute the number of paths for each case.

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        How many paths are there from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(4,3)</m> where the first step is in the <m>y</m>-direction (i.e., paths that pass through the point <m>(0,1)</m>)?

    <statement>
      <p>
        How many paths are there from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(4,3)</m> that first move one step in the <m>x</m>-direction, then one step in the <m>y</m>-direction (so they pass through the points <m>(1,0)</m> and then <m>(1,1)</m>)?

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        List the remaining three cases and how many paths there are for each case.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Verify that the sum of the paths in each case is 35.  Then describe where all these numbers are in Pascal's triangle.  Find another instance of this pattern and verify that it works.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Explain why the coefficient of <m>x^5y^3</m> is the same as the coefficient of <m>x^3y^5</m> in the
        expansion of <m>(x+y)^8</m>? </p>
