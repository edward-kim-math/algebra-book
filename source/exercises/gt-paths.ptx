    <statement>
      <p>
        You and your friends want to tour the southwest by car.
        You will visit the nine states below,
        with the following rather odd rule:
        You must cross each border between neighboring states exactly once
        (so, for example,
        you must cross the Colorado-Utah border exactly once).
        Can you do it?
        If so, does it matter where you start your road trip?
        What fact about graph theory solves this problem?
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a question about finding Euler trails.
        Draw a graph with a vertex in each state,
        and connect vertices if their states share a border.
        Exactly two vertices will have odd degree,
        the vertices for Nevada and Utah.
        Thus you must start your road trip at in one of those states and end it in the other.
