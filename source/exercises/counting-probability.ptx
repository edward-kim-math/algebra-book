    <statement>
      <p>
        When playing 5-card poker, a <term>full house</term> is a hand that contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.  For example, you could have three 7s and two 4s.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Find the probability of being dealt a full house in two different ways:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Assume that all five cards are dealt at once, so that the sample space has size <m>\binom{52}{5}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Assume that the cards are dealt one at a time, so that the sample space has size <m>P(52,5)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        Are the two answers the same?  Why does this make sense?

    <statement>
      <p>
        A random number generator selects single-digit numbers (0 through 9) with equal probability.  Suppose the generator produces five numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the probability that the five numbers will all be different?  Answer this question in two ways:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Assume the numbers come out of the generator in a sequence, so that the sample space has size <m>10^5</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Assume the numbers come out as a multiset, or equivalently, that the numbers must appear in non-decreasing order.  You will want to use sticks and stones to count the size of the sample space.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        Are the two answers the same?  Why does this make sense?

    <statement>
      <p>
        Each of 10 friends has a deck of cards that they shuffle thoroughly. Each friend draws a card from their deck.  What is the probability that at least one pair of friends draw a matching card? 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Use complementary probabilities.  And don't be surprised if your answer is larger than you would have expected.

    <statement>
      <p>
        How many people do you need to have in a room to have a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday (day of the year)?  Assume that all birthdays are equally likely, and that nobody is born on Leap Day (February 29th).

  <statement>
    <p>
      At your 20th high school reunion, you meet an old friend you hadn't heard from in years.  You talk about pets, specifically cats and dogs.  She tells you that she has two pets, and that at least one of them is a cat.  What is the probability that she has two cats?  (Assume that having a cat or a dog is equally likely.)
    </p>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Another old friend overhears your pet conversation and says that he also has two pets, and that the one he has had the longest is a cat.  What is the probability that he has two cats?  And why is this answer different from the previous question?

      You are playing a shell game with three cups.  Under one cup are two green balls, under another cup are two red balls, and under the third cup are one green and one red ball.  You close your eyes, and your friend rearranges the cups.  You then open your eyes and pick a cup at random.  You see that it contains a green ball.  What is the probability that the other ball under that cup is also green?  Explain your answer in terms of conditional probability.
