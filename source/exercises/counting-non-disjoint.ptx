    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be sets.

        <ol>
          <li>
            Find <m>\card{(A \cup C)\setminus B}</m> provided
            <m>\card{A} = 50</m>, <m>\card{B} = 45</m>,
            <m>\card{C} = 40</m>, <m>\card{A\cap B} = 20</m>,
            <m>\card{A \cap C} = 15</m>,
            <m>\card{B \cap C} = 23</m>, and <m>\card{A \cap B \cap C} = 12</m>.
          </li>

          <li>
            Describe a set in terms of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>,
            and <m>C</m> with cardinality 26.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        For part (a) you could use the formula for PIE, but for part (b) you might be better off drawing a Venn diagram.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For how many three-digit numbers (100 to 999) is the
        <em>sum of the digits</em> even? (For example,
        <m>343</m> has an even sum of digits:
        <m>3+4+3 = 10</m> which is even.) Find the answer and explain why it is correct in at least two
        <em>different</em> ways.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You could consider cases.  For example, any number of the form ODD-ODD-EVEN will have an even sum.  Alternatively, how many three-digit numbers have the sum of their digits even if the first two digits are 54?  What if the first two digits are 19?
