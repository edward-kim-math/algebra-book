    <statement>
      <p>
        Each of the counting problems below can be solved with sticks and stones.
        For each, say what outcome the diagram
        <me>
          \o\o\o|\o||\o\o|
        </me>
        represents, if there are the correct number of sticks and stones for the problem.
        Otherwise, say why the diagram does not represent any outcome,
        and what a correct diagram would look like.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              How many ways are there to select a handful of 6 jellybeans from a jar that contains 5 different flavors?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How many ways can you distribute 5 identical lollipops to 6 kids?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How many 6-letter words can you make using the 5 vowels in alphabetical order?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How many solutions are there to the equation
              <m>x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 6</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              You take 3 strawberry, 1 lime, 0 licorice, 2 blueberry, and 0 bubblegum.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This is backwards.
              We don't want the stones to represent the kids because the kids are not identical,
              but the stones are.
              Instead we should use 5 stones
              (for the lollipops)
              and use 5 sticks to switch between the 6 kids.
              For example,
              <me>
                \o\o||\o\o\o|||
              </me>
              would
              represent the outcome with the first kid getting 2 lollipops,
              the third kid getting 3, and the rest of the kids getting none.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This is the word AAAEOO.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This doesn't represent a solution.
              Each stone should represent one of the 6 units that add up to 6, and the sticks should
              <em>switch</em>
              between the different variables.
              We have one too many sticks.
              An example of a correct diagram would be
              <me>
                \o|\o\o||\o\o\o
              </me>,
              representing that
              <m>x_1 = 1</m>,
              <m>x_2 = 2</m>,
              <m>x_3 = 0</m>, and
              <m>x_4 = 3</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </solution>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Solve the three counting problems below.
        Then say why it makes sense that they all have the same answer.
        That is, say how you can interpret them as each other.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              How many ways are there to distribute 8 cookies to 3 kids?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How many solutions in non-negative integers are there to
              <m>x+y+z = 8</m>?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How many different packs of 8 crayons can you make using crayons that come in red,
              blue, and yellow?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        We have represented multisets with sticks and stones diagrams, then counted the number of sticks and stones diagrams to tell us the number of multisets.  This is only a valid process if every multiset corresponds to exactly one sticks and stones diagram, and vice versa.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Clearly write down the rule for how to convert a multiset into a sticks and stones diagram.  That is, describe the function <m>f</m> that takes a multiset as input and outputs a sticks and stones diagram.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that the function <m>f</m> is a bijection.  That is, prove that every sticks and stones diagram corresponds to exactly one multiset, and vice versa.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          This really requires proving four facts.  That every multiset corresponds to at least one diagram, and that every diagram corresponds to at least one multiset.  Then that every multiset corresponds to at most one diagram, and that every diagram corresponds to at most one multiset.  In other words, we must prove that the function is well defined, injective, and surjective.
