    <statement>
      <p>
        Based on the previous question,
        give a combinatorial proof for the identity:
        <me>
          {n \choose k} = {n+k-1 \choose k} - \sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{j+1}{n \choose j}{n+k-(2j+1) \choose k - 2j}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Illustrate how the counting of derangements works by writing all permutations of
        <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m> and then crossing out those which are not derangements.
        Keep track of the permutations you cross out more than once,
        using PIE.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The 9 derangements are: 2143, 2341, 2413, 3142, 3412, 3421, 4123, 4312, 4321.

	<idx><h>derangement</h><h>fraction of all permutations that are</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>d_n</m> be the number of derangements of <m>n</m> objects.
        For example, using the techniques of this section, we find
        <me>
          d_3 = 3!-\left({3 \choose 1}2! - {3 \choose 2}1! + {3 \choose 3}0! \right)
        </me>.
        We can use the formula for
        <m>{n \choose k}</m> to write this all in terms of factorials.
        After simplifying, for <m>d_3</m> we would get
        <me>
          d_3 = 3!\left(1 - \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} \right)
        </me>.
        Generalize this to find a nicer formula for <m>d_n</m>.
        Bonus: For large <m>n</m>,
        approximately what fraction of all permutations are derangements?
        Use your knowledge of Taylor series from calculus.
