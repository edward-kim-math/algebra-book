        For each of the following counting problems,

              Your band goes on tour.

              Neither.
              Assuming you will wear each of the 4 ties on just 4 of the 7 days,

              Neither.
              Since you could repeat letters: <m>10^4</m>.
              If no repeats are allowed, it would be <m>P(10,4)</m>.

              Actually, <q>k</q> is the 11th letter of the alphabet,
              so the answer is 0.
              If <q>k</q> was among the first 10 letters,

              Neither.
              Note that this could not be
              <m>{10 \choose 4}</m> since the 10 things and 4 things are from different groups. <m>4^{10}</m>, assuming each kid eats one type of cereal.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <m>{10 \choose 4}</m>. Don't be fooled by the <q>arrange</q>
            in there. You are picking 4 out of 10
            <em>spots</em> to put the 1's.

          <li>
            <p>
              Neither.
              If all the kids were identical,
              and you wanted no empty teams,
              it would be <m>{10 \choose 4}</m>.
              Instead, this will be the same as the number of surjective functions from a set of size 11 to a set of size 5.

          <li>
            <p>
              Neither.
              It's <m>{10 \choose 4}</m> if you won't repeat any choices.
              If repetition is allowed,
              then this becomes <m>x_1 + x_2 + \cdots +x_{10} = 4</m>,
              which has <m>{13 \choose 9}</m> solutions in non-negative integers.

          <li>
            <p>
              Neither.
              Since repetition of cookie type is allowed,
              the answer is <m>10^4</m>.
              Without repetition, you would have <m>P(10,4)</m>.

          </li>

          <li>
            <m>{10 \choose 4}</m> since that is equal to <m>{9 \choose 4} + {9 \choose 3}</m>.

          <li>
            <p>

              It will be a complicated

    <statement>

        Explain using lattice paths why <m>\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} = 2^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>2^n</m> is the number of lattice paths which have length <m>n</m>,
        since for each step you can go up or right.
        Such a path would end along the line <m>x + y = n</m>.
        So you will end at <m>(0,n)</m>,
        or <m>(1,n-1)</m> or <m>(2, n-2)</m> or
        <ellipsis/> or <m>(n,0)</m>.
        Counting the paths to each of these points separately,
        give <m>{n \choose 0}</m>,
        <m>{n \choose 1}</m>, <m>{n \choose 2}</m>,
        <ellipsis/>, <m>{n \choose n}</m>
        (each time choosing which of the <m>n</m> steps to be to the right).
        These two methods count the same quantity, and so are equal.

        For which of the parts of the previous problem
        (<xref ref="exr-cookie-counting"/>)
        does it make sense to interpret the counting question as counting some number of functions?
        Say what the domain and codomain should be,
        and whether you are counting all functions, injections,
        surjections, or something else.

              You are giving your professor 4 types of cookies coming from 10 different types of cookies.
              This does not lend itself well to a function interpretation.
              We <em>could</em> say that the domain contains the 4 types you will give your professor and the codomain contains the 10 you can choose from,
              but then counting injections would be too much
              (it doesn't matter if you pick type 3 first and type 2 second,
              or the other way around, just that you pick those two types).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We want to consider injective functions from the set <m>\{</m>most,
              second most,
              second least, least<m>\}</m> to the set of 10 cookie types.
              We want injections because we cannot pick the same type of cookie to give most and least of
              (for example).

              This is not a good problem to interpret as a function.
              The problem is that the domain would have to be the 12 cookies you bake,
              but these elements are indistinguishable
              (there is not a first cookie, second cookie, etc.).

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The domain should be the 12 shapes,
              the codomain the 10 types of cookies.
              Since we can use the same type for different shapes,
              we are interested in counting all functions here.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Here we insist that each type of cookie be given at least once,
              so now we are asking for the number of surjections of those functions counted in the previous part.
