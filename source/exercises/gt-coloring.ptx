  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What is the smallest number of colors you need to properly color the vertices of <m>K_{4,5}</m>?
        That is, find the chromatic number of the graph.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        2, since the graph is bipartite.
        One color for the top set of vertices,
        another color for the bottom set of vertices.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Draw a graph with chromatic number 6 (i.e., which requires 6 colors to properly color the vertices).
        Could your graph be planar?
        Explain.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        For example, <m>K_6</m>.
        If the chromatic number is 6, then the graph is not planar;
        the 4-color theorem states that all planar graphs can be colored with 4 or fewer colors.
      </p>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        A group of 10 friends decides to head up to a cabin in the woods (where nothing could possibly go wrong).
        Unfortunately, a number of these friends have dated each other in the past, and things are still a little awkward.
        To get to the cabin, they need to divide up into some number of cars, and no two people who dated should be in the same car.
      </p>

          What is the smallest number of cars you need if all the relationships were strictly heterosexual? Represent an example of such a situation with a graph.

        What is the smallest number of colors that can be used to color the vertices of a cube so that no two adjacent vertices are colored identically?

        The cube can be represented as a planar graph and colored with two colors as follows:

            Eight vertices forming a inner and outer square (with edges forming the sides of each square), with edges connecting each inner vertex to its closest outer vertex neighbor.  The outer vertices are labeled R, B, R, B (starting at the top left and moving clockwise).  The inner vertices are labeled B, R, B, R (starting at the top left and moving clockwise).

      <p>
        Since it would be impossible to color the vertices with a single color,
        we see that the cube has chromatic number 2
        (it is bipartite).

        You have a set of magnetic alphabet letters
        (one of each of the 26 letters in the alphabet)
        that you need to put into boxes.
        For obvious reasons,
        you don't want to put two consecutive letters in the same box.
        What is the fewest number of boxes you need (assuming the boxes are able to hold as many letters as they need to)?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        If we drew a graph with each letter representing a vertex
        and each edge connecting two letters that were consecutive in the alphabet,
        we would have a graph containing two vertices of degree 1 (A and Z) and the remaining 24 vertices all of degree 2
        (for example,
        <m>D</m> would be adjacent to both <m>C</m> and <m>E</m>).
        By Brooks' theorem,
        this graph has chromatic number at most 2, as that is the maximal degree in the graph, and the graph is not a complete graph or odd cycle.
        Thus only two boxes are needed.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you colored the edges of a graph either red or blue (not requiring that adjacent edges be colored differently).  What must be true of the graph to guarantee some vertex is incident to three edges of the same color?  Prove your answer.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You can color <m>K_5</m> in such a way that every vertex is adjacent to exactly two blue edges and two red edges.  However, there is a graph with only 5 edges that will result in a vertex incident to three edges of the same color, no matter how they are colored.  What is it, and how can you generalize?

    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that if you color every edge of <m>K_6</m> either red or blue,
        you are guaranteed a monochromatic triangle
        (that is, an all-red or an all-blue triangle).

        The previous exercise is useful as a starting point.
