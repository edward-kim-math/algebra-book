  <exercise> 
    <statement> <p> Consider the implication, <q>If you clean your room, then you can watch TV.</q> Rephrase the implication in as many ways as possible. Then do the same for the converse. </p> 
    </statement> 
    <hint> <p> Of course there are many answers. It helps to assume that the statement is true and the converse is <em>not</em> true. Think about what that means in the real world, and then start saying it in different ways. Some ideas: Use <q>necessary and sufficient</q> language, use <q>only if,</q> consider negations, use <q>or else</q> language. </p> </hint>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Recall from calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point
        <m>c</m>, then it is continuous at
        <m>c</m>, but that the converse of this statement is not true (for example,
        <m>f(x) = |x|</m> at the point 0).
        Restate this fact using <q>necessary and sufficient</q> language.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        It is true that in order for a function to be differentiable at a point
        <m>c</m>, it is necessary for the function to be continuous at
        <m>c</m>.
        However, it is not necessary that a function be differentiable at
        <m>c</m> for it to be continuous at
        <m>c</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is true that to be continuous at a point
        <m>c</m>, it is sufficient that the function be differentiable at
        <m>c</m>.
        However, it is not the case that being continuous at
        <m>c</m> is sufficient for a function to be differentiable at
        <m>c</m>.

      <idx>
        <h>solitary number</h>
      </idx>
      <statement>
        <p> Consider the statement, <q>For all natural numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n</m> is solitary.</q> You do not need to know what <em>solitary</em> means for this problem, just that it is a property that some numbers have and others do not. <ol>
            <li>
              <p> Write the converse and the contrapositive of the statement, saying which is which. Note: the original statement claims that an implication is true for all <m>n</m>, and it is that implication that we are taking the converse and contrapositive of. </p>
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <p> Write the negation of the original statement. What would you need to show to prove that the statement is false? </p>
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <p> Even though you don't know whether 10 is solitary (in fact, nobody knows this), is the statement, <q>If 10 is prime, then 10 is solitary</q> true or false? Explain. </p>
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <p> It turns out that 8 is solitary. Does this tell you anything about the truth or falsity of the original statement, its converse or its contrapositive? Explain. </p>
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <p> Assuming that the original statement is true, what can you say about the relationship between the <em>set</em>
                <m>P</m> of prime numbers and the <em>set</em>
                <m>S</m> of solitary numbers. Explain. </p>
