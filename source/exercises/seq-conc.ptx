    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose the closed formula for a particular sequence is a degree 3 polynomial.
        What can you say about the closed formula for:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The sequence of partial sums?

            <p>
              The sequence of partial sums will be a degree 4 polynomial
              (its sequence of differences will be the original sequence).

            <p>
              No, taking differences gives the original sequence back,
              so the differences will never be constant.

        reproduce like rabbits:
        every large bunny produces 2 new mini bunnies each day,

              On the first day, your 2 mini bunnies become 2 large bunnies.
              On day 2, your 2 large bunnies produce 4 mini bunnies.
              On day 3, you have 4 mini bunnies
              (produced by your 2 large bunnies)
              plus 6 large bunnies
              (your original 2 plus the 4 newly matured bunnies).
              On day 4, you will have <m>12</m> mini bunnies (2 for each of the 6 large bunnies) plus 10 large bunnies
              (your previous 6 plus the 4 newly matured).
              The sequence of total bunnies is
              <m>2, 2, 6, 10, 22, 42\ldots</m> starting with <m>a_0 = 2</m> and <m>a_1 = 2</m>.

            <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}</m>.
            This is because the number of bunnies is equal to the number of bunnies you had the previous day
            (both mini and large)
            plus 2 times the number you had the day before that

      <p>
        Prove using induction that every set containing <m>n</m> elements has <m>2^n</m> different subsets for any <m>n \ge 1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement,
        <q>Every set containing <m>n</m> elements has <m>2^n</m> different subsets.</q>
        We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

        <u>Base case</u>: Any set with 1 element <m>\{a\}</m> has exactly 2 subsets:
        the empty set and the set itself.
        Thus the number of subsets is <m>2= 2^1</m>.
        Thus <m>P(1)</m> is true.

        <u>Inductive case</u>: Suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>.
        Thus every set containing exactly <m>k</m> elements has <m>2^k</m> different subsets.
        Now consider a set containing <m>k+1</m> elements:
        <m>A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_{k+1}\}</m>.
        Any subset of <m>A</m> must either contain <m>a_{k+1}</m> or not.
        In other words, a subset of <m>A</m> is just a subset of
        <m>\{a_1, a_2,\ldots,
        a_k\}</m> with or without <m>a_{k+1}</m>.
        Thus there are <m>2^k</m> subsets of <m>A</m> which contain <m>a_{k+1}</m> and another <m>2^{k+1}</m> subsets of <m>A</m> which do not contain <m>a^{k+1}</m>.
        This gives a total of <m>2^k + 2^k = 2\cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}</m> subsets of <m>A</m>.
        But our choice of <m>A</m> was arbitrary,
        so this works for any subset containing <m>k+1</m> elements,
        so <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
        Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction,
        <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
