    <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that the candy machine currently holds exactly 650 Skittles,
          and every time someone inserts a quarter,
          exactly 7 Skittles come out of the machine.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                How many Skittles will be left in the machine after 20 quarters have been inserted?
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Will there ever be exactly zero Skittles left in the machine?
                Explain.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Is there a pair of integers <m>(a,b)</m> such that
        <m>a,
        x_1, y_1, b</m> is part of an arithmetic sequence and
        <m>a,
        x_2, y_2, b</m> is part of a geometric sequence with <m>x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2</m> all integers?

    <statement>
      <p>
        Are there any sequences that are both arithmetic and geometric? If so, how many can you find?  If not, explain why not.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Starting with any rectangle, we can create a new,
        larger rectangle by attaching a square to the longer side.
        For example, if we start with a <m>2\times 5</m> rectangle,
        we would glue on a <m>5\times 5</m> square,
        forming a <m>5 \times 7</m> rectangle:

            On the left, a 5x5 square to the right of a rectangle with base 2 and height 5, separated by a small gap.  An arrow points to the right, where a rectangle of base 7 and height 5 is shown, including a dotted line representing where the square and triangle on the left were glued together.

        The next rectangle would be formed by attaching a
        <m>7 \times 7</m> square to the top or bottom of the
        <m>5\times 7</m> rectangle.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Create a sequence of rectangles using this rule starting with a <m>1\times 2</m> rectangle.
              Then write out the sequence of <em>perimeters</em> for the rectangles
              (the first term of the sequence would be 6, since the perimeter of a
              <m>1\times 2</m> rectangle is 6; the next term would be 10).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Repeat the above part, this time starting with a <m>1 \times 3</m> rectangle.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Find recursive formulas for each of the sequences of perimeters you found in parts (a) and (b).
              Don't forget to give the initial conditions as well.

            <p>
              Are the sequences arithmetic?
              Geometric?
              If not, are they <em>close</em>
              to being either of these (i.e., are the differences or ratios
              <em>almost</em> constant)?
              Explain.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that the closed formula for a geometric sequence with initial term <m>a \ne 0</m> and common ratio <m>r</m> is <m>a_n = a r^n</m>, using <em>telescoping</em>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        We can write the recurrence relation as <m>\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}} = r</m>.  What happens when you multiply all the different versions of this recurrence relation (for different values of <m>n</m>) together?
      </p>

    <title>Telescoping to find a sum</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Another context in which sequences arise is calculus when you study sequences and <term>series</term> (which is the word in calculus for what we call a sequence of partial sums).  Some of the techniques we have developed here can be applied there as well.  This is an example of a <term>telescoping sum</term>, similar to the telescoping technique we used.
      </p>

        Consider the sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> that starts <me>\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{15}, \ldots</me>.  That is, each term is the reciprocal of the <m>n</m>th triangular number.  Find the sum of the first <m>n</m> terms of this sequence:
        <me>
          \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{T_k} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{10} + \cdots + \frac{1}{T_n}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Using the fact that <m>T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>, each term in the sequence is <m>\frac{2}{n(n+1)}</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the result of the following fraction subtraction: <m>\frac{2}{3}- \frac{2}{4}</m>, or <m>\frac{2}{4}-\frac{2}{5}</m>?  What is happening in general?

  <exercise>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        A geometric sequence has a constant rate of growth in the sense that the ratio of consecutive terms is always the same.  But what can we say about the <em>difference</em> of consecutive terms in an geometric sequence?  
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the geometric sequence <m>1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots</m>.  Find the differences between consecutive terms.  That is, find its sequence of differences.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find a closed formula for the sequence of differences.  Then use this closed formula to find a different recurrence relation for the original sequence (other than <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1}</m>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Repeat the two parts above for a different geometric sequence of your choice.  Then explain what you found in general.
        </p>
      </statement>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        None of the following sequences are arithmetic or geometric:
        <me>
          1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \ldots
        </me>
        <me>
          3, 5, 8, 12, 17, \ldots
        </me>
        <me>
          0, 2, 5, 9, 14, \ldots 
        </me>
        Explain what these sequences have in common with each other and then use that to find a closed formula for each of them.  How do their closed formulas relate to each other?  What can you say in general?
