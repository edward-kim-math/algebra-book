    <statement>
      <p>
        True or false: for any relation <m>R</m> on a set <m>A</m>, the relation <m>R\inv</m> is symmetric if and only if <m>R</m> is symmetric.  Justify your answer.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        True or false: for any relation <m>R</m> on a set <m>A</m>, the composition of <m>R</m> with its inverse, <m>R\circ R\inv</m>, is always reflexive.  Justify your answer.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find, if possible, an example of a relation on the set <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m> that is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive.  If such a relation exists, draw the directed multigraph of the relation and list the ordered pairs that define it.  Explain your answers.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What is wrong with the following argument that any relation that is symmetric and transitive must be reflexive?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>R</m> is a relation on a set <m>A</m> that is symmetric and transitive.  Since <m>R</m> is symmetric, if <m>aRb</m>, then <m>bRa</m> holds.  Since <m>R</m> is transitive, if <m>aRb</m> and <m>bRa</m>, then <m>aRb</m> holds.  Since this is true for all elements <m>a</m>, we have that <m>aRa</m> is true for all <m>a</m> in <m>A</m>, so <m>R</m> is reflexive.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation on the set <m>A = \{1,2,\ldots,6\}</m>.  What could the directed multigraph for <m>R</m> look like?  Give at least two different examples of such <m>R</m> and their graphs to illustrate your answer.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the relation <m>R</m> on the set <m>A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> defined by <m>R = \{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\}</m>.  Is <m>R</m> an equivalence relation?  Justify your answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of your answer, what do the relation classes <m>[a]</m> for <m>a \in R</m> look like?  Can you tell whether <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation from this information?
      </p>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the <q>loner</q> relation on a set of students that describes friendships, and holds <em>only</em> between a student and themselves (i.e., nobody is friends with anyone other than themselves).  Is this an equivalence relation?  Justify your answer.  If it is an equivalence relation, what do the equivalence classes look like?
