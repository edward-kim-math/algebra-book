			How do we represent the relationships between mathematical objects?
		</p>
		<!-- How can we think of relations informally?
		Talk about relations between a pair of sets, and how we can think of them as a subset of the Cartesian product.
		Talk about relations on a single set.
		Many other structures we have considered are actually relations.
		Functions are relations of a particular type.
		Graphs are relations on a particular set.
		So what is the most general mathematical framework we can give that captures all these ideas?  And then, are there some special cases that we want to consider in more detail?  We look at functions and graphs separately.
		What other special cases are there?  Here we will dive into one carefully, and mention a few others.
		Equivalence relations are relations of a particular type.
		Orders are relations of a particular type.
		We can think of these as special cases of relations, and we can think of relations as generalizations of these concepts.

			To conclude this section, we will look at a few other interesting types of relations.
			This is really just to get you excited about how much math there is out there.

			<p>
				When we studied sets in <xref ref="sec_structures-sets"/>, we considered the <term>subset</term> relation on a collection of sets.
				This gave us an idea of how one set could be <q>smaller</q> than another set.
				In fact, the symbol <m>\subseteq</m> looks a lot like the symbol <m>\leq</m> for less than or equal to.
				And just like we have <m>\lt</m> for <em>strictly</em> less than, we used <m>\subset</m> for a <em>proper</em> subset.
			</p>

			<p>
				That there are two different notions of <q>less than</q> is a clue that we might be able to generalize the idea of <q>less than</q> to a relation on a set that has the essential properties as <q>less than</q>.
				Just as equivalence relations are a generalization of equality, we can generalize the idea of inequality to a relation called a <term>partial order</term>.
