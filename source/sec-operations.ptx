  <p>
  Algebra provides a powerful way of solving many kinds of questions
  Algebra achieves this by enhancing arithmetic.
  Arithmetic focuses on the result of operations like addition and multiplication when using numbers that are constant.
  The contribution of algebra is to enhance arithmetic with variables and with geometry, with a focus on how the numbers appearing a problem <em>relate</em> to each other.
  With these extra ways of thinking, algebra allows us to answer many questions that are really hard to think about using arithmetic alone.

  I want your experience in math to be as smooth and as enjoyable as possible.
  I want this for you, even if you can recall being frustrated with mathematics.
  To achieve that goal, I am deliberately writing this book for you the student, and not for your teacher.
  I hope to take each part of algebra that has the potential to be challenging and <em>really</em> break it down step-by-step.
  This does mean that I may ask you to try something different from the way you have done it in the past.
  I might also ask you to think about things that you haven't really thought about much before.
  I hope you'll give it a shot: what do you have to lose by trying this subject in a new way?
  In fact, I encourage you to really think about the language used in mathematics.
  </p>

  <note>
    <p>
    Pay attention to the language of mathematics.
    </p>
  </note>

  <p>
  As an example of this, when writing <m>2^x</m> be sure to say one of the following:
  <ul>
  <li><q><m>2</m> to the <m>x</m></q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> to the <m>x</m>th power</q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> raised to the <m>x</m></q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> raised to the <m>x</m>th power</q></li>
  </ul>
  If we only say <q><m>2</m></q> then slightly pause to say <q><m>x</m></q> this focuses on the specific individual symbols.
  The bigger problem is that saying <q><m>2</m></q> followed by <q><m>x</m></q> is taken to mean <m>2x</m>.
  Why is this a problem?
  Because <m>2^x</m> and <m>2x</m> are not equal.
  In fact, when <m>x=3</m> then <m>2^x</m> simplifies to <m>8</m>, but <m>2x</m> simplifies to <m>6</m>.

		<title>Order of Operations</title>

    <p>
    We will take a little time to make sure that everyone is on the same page regarding the Order of Operations.
    Before we go any further, we should describe what we mean by an expression.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-expression">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>expression</term> is mathematical notation representing a number.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <aside>
      <p>
      An expression may consist of just a single constant such as <m>3</m> or <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>, 
      or can be a variable representing a number such as <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>, 
      or can be a combination of constants and variables connected by operations such as 
      addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <example>
      <p>
      Both <m>-40</m> and <m>\sqrt{23}</m> are examples of expressions. Both of these expressions are <em>constants</em>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
      Both <m>9x-8</m> and <m>x^2+3x+31</m> are examples of expressions which mention the variable <m>x</m>.
      In the first expression, the variable <m>x</m> is written once.
      In the second expression, the variable <m>x</m> is written twice.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
      The expression <m>x^2+2x+y^2-6y</m> mentions two variables.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
    Please note that an expression does not contain an equal sign. For example, <m>x^2+2x+y^2-6y=22</m> is not an expression.
    The notation that we just wrote instead states that one exrpession is equal to another expression.
    </p>

    <p>
    We need the Order of Operations because this it is easy to misinterpret an expression if we do not all agree on how to read expressions.
    The Order of Operations is a set of rules that tells us the order in which to evaluate (and more generally read) an expression. 
    </p>


    <assemblage permid="order-of-operations">
      <title>Order of Operations</title>
      <p>
        An expression must always be simplified and read by following the <term>Order of Operations</term>:
        <ol>
          <li>Parentheses</li>
          <li>Exponents</li>
          <li>Multiplication and Division (from left to right)</li>
          <li>Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)</li>
        </ol>
      In addition, every time you write an expression, ensure your writing is based on the Order of Operations.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <remark>
      <p>
      By the time we get to the third part of the Order of Operations, all exponents would have been evaluated.
      At this point, we look for any multiplication or division.
      If there is both multiplication and division, we evaluate them from left to right.
      It is not true that multiplication must be done before division.
      All divisions and multiplications that we see have the same level of precedence, and we evaluate them scanning from left to right in that order.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark>
      <p>
      Similarly, by the time we get to the last part of Order of Operations, all multiplications and divisions would have been handled.
      That means that what remains of our expressions should only have addition and subtraction operations remaining.
      These should be handled from left to right.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark>
      <p>
      The Order of Operations is sometimes remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.
      </p>

      <p>
      Because of the way that PEMDAS is often taught, many people mistakenly believe that multiplication must be done before division, and addition must be done before subtraction.
      This is not true.
      For this reason, some people prefer the acronym GEMA, which stands for Grouping symbols, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.
      In the acronym GEMA, the <q>G</q> is used to indicate that there are many kinds of grouping symbols, not just parentheses.
      Also, the multiplication and division are addressed together in the <q>M</q>, and addition and subtraction are addressed together in the <q>A</q>.
      </p>
    </remark>        

    <example xml:id="ex-expression-simplify">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Simplify the expression <m>5^2 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
        We will simplify the expression by following the Order of Operations.
        First, notice that there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next part of the Order of Operations.
        There is a place where the expression has exponens, so we zoom in on <m>5^2</m> and simplify this portion of the expression to <m>25</m>.
        So, the expression given to us becomes <m>25 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now there is no more exponents.
        Next, we look for any multiplication or division.
        We see both multiplication and division, so we evaluate them from left to right.
        The left-most multplication or division we see is the division <m>30 \div 3</m>, which simplifies to <m>10</m>.
        This gives us the expression <m>25 - 10 + 2 \cdot 6</m>.
        Continuing to scan from left to right for any multiplications or divisions, we see the multiplication <m>2 \cdot 6</m>, which simplifies to <m>12</m>.
        This gives us the expression <m>25 - 10 + 12</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now there are no more multiplications or divisions, we look for any additions or subtractions, starting from the left.
        The left-most addition or subtraction we see is the subtraction <m>25 - 10</m>, which simplifies to <m>15</m>.
        This gives us the expression <m>15 + 12</m>.
        Continuing to scan from left to right for any additions or subtractions, we see the addition <m>15 + 12</m>, which simplifies to <m>27</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Because this was our first example of applying the Order of Operations, we wanted to be very thorough to explain each step.
        To present our work, we start from the original expression and after writing an equal sign 
        (to indicate that what we will write next is equal) write a simplified version of the expression.
        We continue this process until we reach the final simplified expression. For this example, we have
        <m>5^2 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6 = 25 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6 = 25 - 10 + 2 \cdot 6 = 25 - 10 + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is also acceptable to write each expressions on their own lines, as follows:
        <md>
        <mrow>5^2 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6 \amp = 25 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 25 - 10 + 2 \cdot 6</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 25 - 10 + 12</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 15 + 12</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 27</mrow> 
        </md>
        Note that when presenting our work <em>vertically</em> we still include the equal signs to indicate 
        that each expression is equal to the previous expression.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

      When simplifying any expression, it is important to include equal signs to indicate that each expression is equal to the previous expression.

    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
      While simplifying expressions, ensure that the next expression you write is truly equal to the previous expression, instead of just writing the portion of the expression that is changing.

    </remark>

    <example>

      </statement>
      <solution>
          <p>
          We can present our work horizontally, continuing to always write to the right of an equal sign like this <m>3 \cdot (6 - 4)^2 \div 2 = 3 \cdot 2^2 \div 2 = 3 \cdot 4 \div 2 = 12 \div 2 = 6</m>.
          </p>

          = 200 - 16 \div 8 \times 5 + 6 
          = 200 - 2 \times 5 + 6 
          = 200 - 10 + 6 
          = 190 + 6 
          = 196

		<title>Order of Operations with variables</title>

    <p>
    It is important for us to apply the Order of Operations not <em>only</em> to simplify expressions that contain only constants,
    but to also apply the Order of Operations when to interpret expressions that contain variables.
    This is important because one of the main contributions of algebra over arithmetic is to use variables to represent numbers that we do not know yet.
    So even when expressions contain variables, we still must read and write based on the Order of Operations.
    Doing this might feel new and totally weird, but let's explain how it's done and walk through examples together.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="order-of-operations-variables">
      <title>How to apply Order of Operations to expressions with variables</title>
      <p>
        Given an expression:
        <ol>
          <li>Identify each operation that is written in the given expression.</li>
          <li>Apply the Order of Operations to identify in which order the operations <em>would</em> be performed.</li>
        </ol>
        Instead of simplifying an expression, we would hypothetically perform the operations.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <example xml:id="ex-expression-simplify-variables">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What order are the operations performed in the expression <m>z^3 - xy</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        The expression <m>z^3 - xy</m> has three operations.
        Scanning from left to right, we see the following operations present: exponentiation, subtraction, and multiplication.
        When there is no symbol written between two variables, there is a hidden multiplication sign.
        In fact, to make it clearer, we can rewrite the expression as <m>z^3 - x \cdot y</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now that we have identified which operations are present in this expression (in this example, three of them) 
        we will apply the Order of Operations to determine in which order these operations would be performed.

        <ul>
          <li>
          Since there are no parentheses in our expression, the first operation that we would perform is the exponentiation.
          That is, if we knew the value of <m>z</m>, then we would first simplify <m>z^3</m>.</li>
          <li>Next, we would perform the multiplication <m>x \cdot y</m>. In other words, if we knew the value of <m>x</m> and we knew the value of <m>y</m>, then our work in this second step would be to simplify, and we'd have <m>xy</m>, <q>whatever the value of that is</q></li>
          <li>Finally, we would perform the subtraction: we would take whatever the value of <m>z^3</m> and subtract from this whatever the vaule of <m>x \cdot y</m> is to get <m>z^3 - (x \cdot y)</m>.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Notice that we never simplified the expression <m>z^3 - xy</m> or any part of this expression.
      We couldn't, because we did not know the numerical value of any of the variables.
      It seems like what we're doing is lazy, but I want to spin this into something positive.
      I encourage you to think of it this way: since we don't have the numbers behind the variables, we <em>get</em> to be lazy!
    </p>

    <p>
      To perform this kind of analysis, it is helpful to say phrases like <q>whatever the value of <em>that</em> is</q>.
      We are discussing in which order we would <em>hypothetically</em> perform the operations, if we knew the values of the variables. 
      It seems like what we're doing is a bit silly, but it is important to practice this way of thinking.
      It is rare that I'll encourage the following, but I encourage you to say out loud the full text of the next several examples, 
      pausing right before any phrase that looks similar to <q>whatever the value of <em>that</em> is</q> 
      when this kind of phrase appears right after an expression followed by a comma.      
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What order are the operations performed in the expression <m>(a+b) \cdot c^6</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, we identify the operations present, which are an addition, a multiplication written as a dot, and exponentiation.
          In addition, a part of the expression is contained inside parentheses.
        </p>
        <p>

        <ul>
          <li>Since <m>a+b</m> is in parentheses, we would perform the addition first. So, if we hypothetically knew the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, we'd replace this with the value of <m>a+b</m>, whatever value that is.</li>
          <li>After this, there would be no parentheses. Since all that would be left is a multiplication and an exponentiation, we would perform the exponentiation. We would take whatever the value of <m>c</m> is and raise this value to the <m>6</m>th power. This would give us <m>c^6</m>, whatever the value of <em>that</em> is.</li>
          <li>Finally, we'd take whatever the value of <m>(a+b)</m> is and whatever the value of <m>c^6</m> is and multiply these values together.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Notice that we never simplified the expression <m>(a+b) \cdot c^6</m> or any part of this expression.
      This process may feel weird to you because you may never have been asked about analyzing expressions in this way.
      Digging into the careful details of how to analyze an expression like this often gets overlooked but this next-level type of problem
      in applynig the Order of Operations sets up an important foundation for reading and writing expressions in algebra correctly.
      It's weird because it's new, but it's important because algebra enhances arithmetic by having variables, 
      so I want you to be comfortable with reading and writing expressions with variables.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What order are the operations performed in the expression <m>a(b-c)^4+7d</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To make it clearer where the operations are, let's rewrite the expression as <m>a \cdot (b-c)^4 + 7 \cdot d</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Since <m>b-c</m> is in parentheses, we would perform this subtraction first.</li>
          <li>Next, there would be no more parentheses, so we would perform the exponentiation: we would take <m>(b-c)</m>, 
          whatever the value of <m>(b-c)</m> is, and raise this to the <m>4</m>th power. 
          Thus, we'd have whatever the value of <m>(b-c)^4</m> is.</li>
          <li>Next, we would perform the multiplication <m>a \cdot (b-c)^4</m>. 
          That is, if we knew the value of <m>a</m> we would multiply this by the value of value of <m>(b-c)^4</m> from the previous step, 
          which would give us <m>a \cdot (b-c)^4</m>, <q>whatever the value of that is</q>.</li>
          <li>Then, we would perform the multiplication <m>7 \cdot d</m>. 
          That is, if we knew the value of <m>d</m>, we would simplify <m>7 \cdot d</m>.</li>
          <li>Finally, we would perform the addition: we would take whatever the value of <m>a \cdot (b-c)^4</m> is 
          and add to this whatever the value of <m>7 \cdot d</m> is.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      The activity we just went through leads up to the following new type of activity.
      We will be given two expressions which will only differ from each other in the inclusion or removal of a set of parentheses.
      Then, we will determine if the two expressions are equal, or if we don't know based only on the Order of Operations.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Based only on the Order of Operations, are <m>x-(y \cdot z)</m> and <m>x - y \cdot z</m> equal or do we not have enough information?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the first expression <m>x-(y \cdot z)</m>, 
              we perform the multiplication <m>y \cdot z</m> first because the multiplication is in parentheses. 
              Then we perform the subtraction of <m>x</m> and <m>y \cdot z</m> to get <m>x - (y \cdot z)</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the second expression <m>x - y \cdot z</m>, there are no parentheses.
              We perform the multiplication <m>y \cdot z</m> first.
              Then we perform the subtraction of <m>x</m> and <m>y \cdot z</m> to get <m>x - y \cdot z</m>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        In both expressions, we perform the multiplication <m>y \cdot z</m> first, and then we perform the subtraction of <m>x</m> and <m>y \cdot z</m> next.
        Based only on the Order of Operations, the two expressions are equal.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>

        If these expressions happened to be equal, this would have to be explained by something <em>other</em> than the Order of Operations.)
