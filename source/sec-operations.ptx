  Algebra provides a powerful way of solving many kinds of questions
  Algebra achieves this by enhancing arithmetic.
  Arithmetic focuses on the result of operations like addition and multiplication when using numbers that are constant.
  The contribution of algebra is to enhance arithmetic with variables and with geometry, with a focus on how the numbers appearing a problem <em>relate</em> to each other.
  With these extra ways of thinking, algebra allows us to answer many questions that are really hard to think about using arithmetic alone.

  I want your experience in math to be as smooth and as enjoyable as possible.
  I want this for you, even if you can recall being frustrated with mathematics.
  To achieve that goal, I am deliberately writing this book for you the student, and not for your teacher.
  I hope to take each part of algebra that has the potential to be challenging and <em>really</em> break it down step-by-step.
  This does mean that I may ask you to try something different from the way you have done it in the past.
  I might also ask you to think about things that you haven't really thought about much before.
  I hope you'll give it a shot: what do you have to lose by trying this subject in a new way?
  In fact, I encourage you to really think about the language used in mathematics.
  </p>

  <note>
    <p>
    Pay attention to the language of mathematics.
    </p>
  </note>

  <p>
  As an example of this, when writing <m>2^x</m> be sure to say one of the following:
  <ul>
  <li><q><m>2</m> to the <m>x</m></q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> to the <m>x</m>th power</q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> raised to the <m>x</m></q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> raised to the <m>x</m>th power</q></li>
  </ul>
  If we only say <q><m>2</m></q> then slightly pause to say <q><m>x</m></q> this focuses on the specific individual symbols.
  The bigger problem is that saying <q><m>2</m></q> followed by <q><m>x</m></q> is taken to mean <m>2x</m>.
  Why is this a problem?
  Because <m>2^x</m> and <m>2x</m> are not equal.
  In fact, when <m>x=3</m> then <m>2^x</m> simplifies to <m>8</m>, but <m>2x</m> simplifies to <m>6</m>.

		<title>Order of Operations</title>

    <p>
    We will take a little time to make sure that everyone is on the same page regarding the Order of Operations.
    Before we go any further, we should describe what we mean by an expression.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-expression">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>expression</term> is mathematical notation representing a number.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <aside>
      <p>
      An expression may consist of just a single constant such as <m>3</m> or <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>, 
      or can be a variable representing a number such as <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>, 
      or can be a combination of constants and variables connected by operations such as 
      addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <example>
      <p>
      Both <m>-40</m> and <m>\sqrt{23}</m> are examples of expressions. Both of these expressions are <em>constants</em>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
      Writing <m>-40+\sqrt{64}</m> is another expressions.
      This is an expression even if we haven't simplified this to the value <m>-32</m>.
      Like the two expressions in the previous example, the expression shown here (both the unsimplified and the simplified versions)
      is a <em>constant</em>, since the expression lacks any variable(s).
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
      Both <m>9x-8</m> and <m>x^2+3x+31</m> are examples of expressions which mention the variable <m>x</m>.
      In the first expression, the variable <m>x</m> is written once.
      In the second expression, the variable <m>x</m> is written twice.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
      The expression <m>x^2+2x+y^2-6y</m> mentions two variables. Since one or more variables appear, this expression is <em>not</em> a constant.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
    Please note that an expression does not contain an equal sign. For example, <m>x^2+2x+y^2-6y=22</m> is not an expression.
    The notation that we just wrote instead states that one exrpession is equal to another expression.
    </p>

    <p>
    We need the Order of Operations because this it is easy to misinterpret an expression if we do not all agree on how to read expressions.
    The Order of Operations is a set of rules that tells us the order in which to evaluate (and more generally read) an expression. 
    </p>


    <assemblage permid="order-of-operations">
      <title>Order of Operations</title>
      <p>
        An expression must always be simplified and read by following the <term>Order of Operations</term>:
        <ol>
          <li>Parentheses</li>
          <li>Exponents</li>
          <li>Multiplication and Division (from left to right)</li>
          <li>Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)</li>
        </ol>
      In addition, every time you write an expression, ensure your writing is based on the Order of Operations.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <remark>
      <p>
      By the time we get to the third part of the Order of Operations, all exponents would have been evaluated.
      At this point, we look for any multiplication or division.
      If there is both multiplication and division, we evaluate them from left to right.
      It is not true that multiplication must be done before division.
      All divisions and multiplications that we see have the same level of precedence, and we evaluate them scanning from left to right in that order.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark>
      <p>
      Similarly, by the time we get to the last part of Order of Operations, all multiplications and divisions would have been handled.
      That means that what remains of our expressions should only have addition and subtraction operations remaining.
      These should be handled from left to right.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark>
      <p>
      The Order of Operations is sometimes remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.
      </p>

      <p>
      Because of the way that PEMDAS is often taught, many people mistakenly believe that multiplication must be done before division, and addition must be done before subtraction.
      This is not true.
      For this reason, some people prefer the acronym GEMA, which stands for Grouping symbols, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.
      In the acronym GEMA, the <q>G</q> is used to indicate that there are many kinds of grouping symbols, not just parentheses.
      Also, the multiplication and division are addressed together in the <q>M</q>, and addition and subtraction are addressed together in the <q>A</q>.
      </p>
    </remark>        

    <example xml:id="ex-expression-simplify">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Simplify the expression <m>5^2 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
        We will simplify the expression by following the Order of Operations.
        First, notice that there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next part of the Order of Operations.
        There is a place where the expression has exponens, so we zoom in on <m>5^2</m> and simplify this portion of the expression to <m>25</m>.
        So, the expression given to us becomes <m>25 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now there is no more exponents.
        Next, we look for any multiplication or division.
        We see both multiplication and division, so we evaluate them from left to right.
        The left-most multplication or division we see is the division <m>30 \div 3</m>, which simplifies to <m>10</m>.
        This gives us the expression <m>25 - 10 + 2 \cdot 6</m>.
        Continuing to scan from left to right for any multiplications or divisions, we see the multiplication <m>2 \cdot 6</m>, which simplifies to <m>12</m>.
        This gives us the expression <m>25 - 10 + 12</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now there are no more multiplications or divisions, we look for any additions or subtractions, starting from the left.
        The left-most addition or subtraction we see is the subtraction <m>25 - 10</m>, which simplifies to <m>15</m>.
        This gives us the expression <m>15 + 12</m>.
        Continuing to scan from left to right for any additions or subtractions, we see the addition <m>15 + 12</m>, which simplifies to <m>27</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Because this was our first example of applying the Order of Operations, we wanted to be very thorough to explain each step.
        To present our work, we start from the original expression and after writing an equal sign 
        (to indicate that what we will write next is equal) write a simplified version of the expression.
        We continue this process until we reach the final simplified expression. For this example, we have
        <m>5^2 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6 = 25 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6 = 25 - 10 + 2 \cdot 6 = 25 - 10 + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is also acceptable to write each expressions on their own lines, as follows:
        <md>
        <mrow>5^2 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6 \amp = 25 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 25 - 10 + 2 \cdot 6</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 25 - 10 + 12</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 15 + 12</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 27</mrow> 
        </md>
        Note that when presenting our work <em>vertically</em> we still include the equal signs to indicate 
        that each expression is equal to the previous expression.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

      <p>
        While simplifying expressions, ensure that the next expression you write is truly equal to the previous expression, instead of just writing the portion of the expression that is changing.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <example>
      <statement>

      </statement>
      <solution>
          <p>
          We can present our work horizontally, continuing to always write to the right of an equal sign like this <m>3 \cdot (6 - 4)^2 \div 2 = 3 \cdot 2^2 \div 2 = 3 \cdot 4 \div 2 = 12 \div 2 = 6</m>.
          </p>

          We can instead present our work vertically

      <solution>
        <p>
          We can present our work horizontally, always writing to the right of the equal sign like this:

          200 - 4^2 \div 8 \times 5 + 6 
          = 200 - 16 \div 8 \times 5 + 6 
          = 200 - 2 \times 5 + 6 
          = 200 - 10 + 6 
          = 190 + 6 
          = 196
          </m>.

		<title>Order of Operations with variables</title>

    <p>
    It is important for us to apply the Order of Operations not <em>only</em> to simplify expressions that contain only constants,
    but to also apply the Order of Operations when to interpret expressions that contain variables.
    This is important because one of the main contributions of algebra over arithmetic is to use variables to represent numbers that we do not know yet.
    So even when expressions contain variables, we still must read and write based on the Order of Operations.
    Doing this might feel new and totally weird, but let's explain how it's done and walk through examples together.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="order-of-operations-variables">
      <title>How to apply Order of Operations to expressions with variables</title>
      <p>
        Given an expression:
        <ol>
          <li>Identify each operation that is written in the given expression.</li>
          <li>Apply the Order of Operations to identify in which order the operations <em>would</em> be performed.</li>
        </ol>
        Instead of simplifying an expression, we would hypothetically perform the operations.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <example xml:id="ex-expression-simplify-variables">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What order are the operations performed in the expression <m>z^3 - xy</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        The expression <m>z^3 - xy</m> has three operations.
        Scanning from left to right, we see the following operations present: exponentiation, subtraction, and multiplication.
        When there is no symbol written between two variables, there is a hidden multiplication sign.
        In fact, to make it clearer, we can rewrite the expression as <m>z^3 - x \cdot y</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now that we have identified which operations are present in this expression (in this example, three of them) 
        we will apply the Order of Operations to determine in which order these operations would be performed.

        <ul>
          <li>
          Since there are no parentheses in our expression, the first operation that we would perform is the exponentiation.
          That is, if we knew the value of <m>z</m>, then we would first simplify <m>z^3</m>.</li>
          <li>Next, we would perform the multiplication <m>x \cdot y</m>. In other words, if we knew the value of <m>x</m> and we knew the value of <m>y</m>, then our work in this second step would be to simplify, and we'd have <m>xy</m>, <q>whatever the value of that is</q></li>
          <li>Finally, we would perform the subtraction: we would take whatever the value of <m>z^3</m> and subtract from this whatever the vaule of <m>x \cdot y</m> is to get <m>z^3 - (x \cdot y)</m>.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Notice that we never simplified the expression <m>z^3 - xy</m> or any part of this expression.
      We couldn't, because we did not know the numerical value of any of the variables.
      It seems like what we're doing is lazy, but I want to spin this into something positive.
      I encourage you to think of it this way: since we don't have the numbers behind the variables, we <em>get</em> to be lazy!
    </p>

    <p>
      To perform this kind of analysis, it is helpful to say phrases like <q>whatever the value of <em>that</em> is</q>.
      We are discussing in which order we would <em>hypothetically</em> perform the operations, if we knew the values of the variables. 
      It seems like what we're doing is a bit silly, but it is important to practice this way of thinking.
      It is rare that I'll encourage the following, but I encourage you to say out loud the full text of the next several examples, 
      pausing right before any phrase that looks similar to <q>whatever the value of <em>that</em> is</q> 
      when this kind of phrase appears right after an expression followed by a comma.      
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What order are the operations performed in the expression <m>(a+b) \cdot c^6</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, we identify the operations present, which are an addition, a multiplication written as a dot, and exponentiation.
          In addition, a part of the expression is contained inside parentheses.
        </p>
        <p>

        <ul>
          <li>Since <m>a+b</m> is in parentheses, we would perform the addition first. So, if we hypothetically knew the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, we'd replace this with the value of <m>a+b</m>, whatever value that is.</li>
          <li>After this, there would be no parentheses. Since all that would be left is a multiplication and an exponentiation, we would perform the exponentiation. We would take whatever the value of <m>c</m> is and raise this value to the <m>6</m>th power. This would give us <m>c^6</m>, whatever the value of <em>that</em> is.</li>
          <li>Finally, we'd take whatever the value of <m>(a+b)</m> is and whatever the value of <m>c^6</m> is and multiply these values together.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Notice that we never simplified the expression <m>(a+b) \cdot c^6</m> or any part of this expression.
      This process may feel weird to you because you may never have been asked about analyzing expressions in this way.
      Digging into the careful details of how to analyze an expression like this often gets overlooked but this next-level type of problem
      in applynig the Order of Operations sets up an important foundation for reading and writing expressions in algebra correctly.
      It's weird because it's new, but it's important because algebra enhances arithmetic by having variables, 
      so I want you to be comfortable with reading and writing expressions with variables.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What order are the operations performed in the expression <m>a(b-c)^4+7d</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To make it clearer where the operations are, let's rewrite the expression as <m>a \cdot (b-c)^4 + 7 \cdot d</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Since <m>b-c</m> is in parentheses, we would perform this subtraction first.</li>
          <li>Next, there would be no more parentheses, so we would perform the exponentiation: we would take <m>(b-c)</m>, 
          whatever the value of <m>(b-c)</m> is, and raise this to the <m>4</m>th power. 
          Thus, we'd have whatever the value of <m>(b-c)^4</m> is.</li>
          <li>Next, we would perform the multiplication <m>a \cdot (b-c)^4</m>. 
          That is, if we knew the value of <m>a</m> we would multiply this by the value of value of <m>(b-c)^4</m> from the previous step, 
          which would give us <m>a \cdot (b-c)^4</m>, <q>whatever the value of that is</q>.</li>
          <li>Then, we would perform the multiplication <m>7 \cdot d</m>. 
          That is, if we knew the value of <m>d</m>, we would simplify <m>7 \cdot d</m>.</li>
          <li>Finally, we would perform the addition: we would take whatever the value of <m>a \cdot (b-c)^4</m> is 
          and add to this whatever the value of <m>7 \cdot d</m> is.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      The activity we just went through leads up to the following new type of activity.
      We will be given two expressions which will only differ from each other in the inclusion or removal of a set of parentheses.
      Then, we will determine if the two expressions are equal, or if we don't know based only on the Order of Operations.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>

		<title>Language</title>

    <p>
      Before we move on, let's be sure that we're on the same page regarding some language used to describe expressions.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An expression that is the result of adding and/or subtracting two or more expressions together is called a <term>sum</term>.
          Each individual piece of the sum is called a <term>term</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <p>
          The expression <m>3x + 5y - 7</m> is the result of adding and subtracting expressions together, so is called a sum.
          The three terms in this sum are <m>3x</m>, <m>5y</m>, and <m>7</m>.

        <p>
          An expression that is the result of multiplying two or more expressions together is called a <term>product</term>.
          Each individual piece of the product is called a <term>factor</term>.

        <p>
          The expression <m>4x^2 + 3y - 7\div z</m> is a sum.

		<title>Pictures</title>

    <p>
      In algebra, we will often use pictures to represent expressions.
      This is a powerful way to think about expressions, and it is important to be able to translate between pictures and expressions.
      This may be new to you, but I encourage you to give it a try!
      Practicing this now will make future concepts go smoother!

    We have drawn the sticks slightly separated so that we can see them individually, but in reality we should imagine them pushed together.
    In the drawing, I made the choice to represent <m>a</m> as a slightly larger number than <m>b</m>.
    In addition, I chose to draw the stick representing <m>a</m> on the left and the stick representing <m>b</m> on the right because in the expression
    <m>a+b</m>, the <m>a</m> appears to the left of the plus sign, while the <m>b</m> appears to the right of the plus sign.

    Having the Commutative Property of Addition and the Associative Property of Addition together basically tells us that 
    when the expression we have is a sum, we can rearrange the terms in any order we want and simplify the addition of any terms in any order we want.
    For example <m>5a + 3b - 7c + 12d^8</m> is equal to <m>12d^8 - 7c + 5a + 3b</m> and is also equal to <m> - 7c + 3b+ 12d^8 + 5a</m>.
    When rearranging, be sure that any minus sign that was in front of a term stays in front of that term.

      It may be new and strange to you.
      It may seem like a waste of time to you.
      So far, it may just seem like a silly to give a geometric explanation of why certain facts (that might even feel obvious to you) are explained using geometry.

    <title>How do I prevent confusing the two geometric representations?</title>
    <p>
      The geometric representation of addition is the gluing together of sticks.
      The geometric representation of multiplication is the area of a rectangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      One technique to help recall which is which is to recall that a usual presentation of the area formula is <m>A = \ell w</m>.
      Because this formula multiplies together two quantities (named <m>\ell</m> and <m>w</m>), we can remember that multiplication is represented by area.
      Since addition is not represented by area, it must be represented by the other geometric idea we've seen, which is gluing sticks together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's another techinque! Pick two numbers where the sum of the two numbers and the product of the two numbers is different.
      What I mean is that we wouldn't want to pick <m>2</m> and <m>2</m>, since both the sum and the product are <m>4</m>.
      <ol>
        <li>If we pick <m>2</m> and <m>3</m>, we can ask ourselves what geometric object has some aspect of having size <m>5</m> and what geometric object has some aspect of having size <m>6</m>.
          The object with size <m>5</m> is a stick of length <m>5</m>, which is the result of gluing together a stick of length <m>2</m> and a stick of length <m>3</m>.
          The object with size <m>6</m> is a rectangle with area <m>6</m>, which is the result of multiplying together <m>2</m> and <m>3</m>.
        </li>
        <li>If we pick <m>4</m> and <m>7</m>, we can ask ourselves what geometric object has some aspect of having size <m>11</m> and what geometric object has some aspect of having size <m>28</m>.
          The object with size <m>11</m> is a stick of length <m>11</m>, which is the result of gluing together a stick of length <m>4</m> and a stick of length <m>7</m>.
          The object with size <m>28</m> is a rectangle with area <m>28</m>, which is the result of multiplying together <m>4</m> and <m>7</m>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      You can pick any two numbers you want, as long as the sum and product are different
    </p>
  </assemblage>

  <p>
    We are now about to talk about an important algebra property that mentions both addition and multiplication.
    When we look at the geometric representation, we will need both geometric representations: gluing together of sticks <em>and</em> area of rectangles will <em>both</em> appear.

      Before digging in, let's note that in the diagram the left, we see a stick of length <m>b</m> glued to a stick of length <m>c</m>, making a stick of length <m>b+c</m>.
      (This makes use of the geometric representation of addition.)

      The area of the big rectangle on the left is equal to the sum of the areas of the two rectangles on the right,
      since we can get from the rectangle on the left to the two rectangles on the right by cutting the rectangle on the left vertically into two pieces.
      Since the area of the big rectangle on the left is equal to the sum of the areas of the two rectangles on the right,
      the two expressions they represent, namely <m>a(b+c)</m> and <m>ab+ac</m>, are equal.

    we can substitute any expression we want for the <m>a</m>, any expression we want for the <m>b</m>, and any expression we want for the <m>c</m>.
    If we can for a moment explain what the Distributive Law is saying informally,
    the result of <q>this</q> times the sum of <q>that</q> and <q>the other thing</q> is the same as <q>this</q> times <q>that</q> plus <q>this</q> times <q>the other thing</q>.
    For example the Distributive Law tells us that <m>x(3y + 5)</m> is equal to <m>3xy + 5x</m>.
  </p>

  <note>
    <p>
      When you see <m>x(3y + 5)</m>, I encourage you to think about the Distributive Law as we wrote it <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m>, 
      and relate the <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> in the formula
      to the <m>x</m> and <m>3y</m> and <m>5</m> in the expression <m>x(3y + 5)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to dismiss this advice and just think
      <q>What's the point of all this? I can just see that I should distribute <m>x</m>.</q>
      However, it is important to see exactly what this Distributive Law <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m> is saying, and what it is <em>not</em> saying.
      The left side <m>a(b+c)</m> addresses <em>only</em> an expression that has addition on the inside of the parentheses, and multiplication outside.
      For example, the formula <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m> has <em>nothing</em> to say about the expression <m>j + (k \cdot \sqrt{m})</m>.
      It would be tempting to look at <m>j + (k \cdot \sqrt{m})</m> and try to <q>distribute</q> the <m>j</m> somehow.
      But when we read the left side of <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m> and we see that the left side says <m>a(b+c)</m>, we have to carefully note that addition is inside the parentheses with multiplication outside.
      The problem with <m>j + (k \cdot \sqrt{m})</m> is that multiplication is inside the parentheses with the addition outside.
      So the Distributive Law <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m> does not apply to <m>j + (k \cdot \sqrt{m})</m>.

      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Using the Distributive Law <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m>, we can let <m>a=5</m>, <m>b=x</m>, and <m>c=2</m>.
        Then we have
        <me>
          5(x + 2) = 5 \cdot x + 5 \cdot 2 = 5x + 10.
        </me>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use the Distributive Law to rewrite <m>10(h^2 + t^3)</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Using the Distributive Law <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m>, we can let <m>a=10</m>, <m>b=h^2</m>, and <m>c=t^3</m>.
        Then we have
        <me>
          10(h^2 + t^3) = 10 \cdot h^2 + 10 \cdot t^3 = 10h^2 + 10t^3.
        </me>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    In the example above, we informally say that we <q><term>distributed</term> 10</q>.
    We can also turn an expression of the form <m>ab + ac</m> into an expression of the form <m>a(b+c)</m>.
    This process is called <term>factoring</term>.
    (Factoring is the reverse of the process of distributing.)

  <p>
    This version has subtraction inside the parentheses instead of addition inside the parentheses.
    Since we didn't provide a geometric representation of subtraction, we won't provide a geometric explanation of why this version of the Distributive Law is true.
    (However, for a mental challenge, we can use the first version of the Distributive Law to explain why this version is true.
    We can think of <m>b-c</m> as <m>b+(-c)</m>, and then apply the first version of the Distributive Law.)

  <p>
    The last two examples show that the process known as <term>collecting like terms</term> is actually justified by the Distributive Law.
    In fact, the only reason why collecting like terms works at all is because of the Distributive Law!
    Collecting like terms is actually factoring out the variable from several terms (though we often skip writing that <q>middle step</q> such as <m>(13-7)x</m> and just simplify the part that is in parentheses in our head.)
  </p>

  <note>
    <p>
      It may be tempting to ignore this comment about the connection between collecting like terms and the Distributive Law.
      If we ignore the connection, it would be easy to see an expression like <m>3x + \sqrt{7}\,x</m> and feel stuck thinking
      that we <q>can't</q> collect like terms.
      However, if we remember that collecting like terms is actually factoring, then we can see that
      <me>
        3x + \sqrt{7}\,x = (3 + \sqrt{7})x.
      </me>
      In another example like <m>3x+5x=(3+5)x=8x</m> we very often skip writing the middle step <m>(3+5)x</m> 
      and just directly go from <m>3x+5x</m> to <m>8x</m>.
      However, it's good to remember that there is a middle step, and that middle step is justified by the Distributive Law.
      Recalling this allows us to not get intimidated by expressions like <m>3x + \sqrt{7}\,x</m>.

		<title>Summary</title>

    <p>Expressions with and without variables can be interpreted and analyzed using the Order of Operations, and expressions without variables can be simplified down to a single constant using the Order of Operations.
    The result of adding and subtracting expressions called terms results in a sum, while the result of multiplying expression called factors results in a product.
    The geometric representation of addition by gluing together sticks and the geometric representation of multiplication by the area of a rectangle 
    can be used to justify major algebraic formulas, including the Distributive Law.
    It is the Distributive Law which actually justifies the shortcut process known as collecting like terms.
