  <title>Operations</title>

  <p>
  Algebra provides a powerful way of solving many kinds of questions
  Algebra achieves this by enhancing arithmetic.
  Arithmetic focuses on the result of operations like addition and multiplication when using numbers that are constant.
  The contribution of algebra is to enhance arithmetic with variables and with geometry, with a focus on how the numbers appearing a problem <em>relate</em> to each other.
  With these extra ways of thinking, algebra allows us to answer many questions that are really hard to think about using arithmetic alone.

  I want your experience in math to be as smooth and as enjoyable as possible.
  I want this for you, even if you can recall being frustrated with mathematics.
  To achieve that goal, I am deliberately writing this book for you the student, and not for your teacher.
  I hope to take each part of algebra that has the potential to be challenging and <em>really</em> break it down step-by-step.
  This does mean that I may ask you to try something different from the way you have done it in the past.
  I might also ask you to think about things that you haven't really thought about much before.
  I hope you'll give it a shot: what do you have to lose by trying this subject in a new way?
  In fact, I encourage you to really think about the language used in mathematics.

    <p>
    Pay attention to the language of mathematics.

  As an example of this, when writing <m>2^x</m> be sure to say one of the following:
  <ul>
  <li><q><m>2</m> to the <m>x</m></q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> to the <m>x</m>th power</q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> raised to the <m>x</m></q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> raised to the <m>x</m>th power</q></li>
  </ul>
  If we only say <q><m>2</m></q> then slightly pause to say <q><m>x</m></q> this focuses on the specific individual symbols.
  The bigger problem is that saying <q><m>2</m></q> followed by <q><m>x</m></q> is taken to mean <m>2x</m>.
  Why is this a problem?
  Because <m>2^x</m> and <m>2x</m> are not equal.
  In fact, when <m>x=3</m> then <m>2^x</m> simplifies to <m>8</m>, but <m>2x</m> simplifies to <m>6</m>.
