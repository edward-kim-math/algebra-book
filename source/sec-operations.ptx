  <title>Operations</title>

  <p>
  Algebra provides a powerful way of solving many kinds of questions
  Algebra achieves this by enhancing arithmetic.
  Arithmetic focuses on the result of operations like addition and multiplication when using numbers that are constant.
  The contribution of algebra is to enhance arithmetic with variables and with geometry, with a focus on how the numbers appearing a problem <em>relate</em> to each other.
  With these extra ways of thinking, algebra allows us to answer many questions that are really hard to think about using arithmetic alone.

  I want your experience in math to be as smooth and as enjoyable as possible.
  I want this for you, even if you can recall being frustrated with mathematics.
  To achieve that goal, I am deliberately writing this book for you the student, and not for your teacher.
  I hope to take each part of algebra that has the potential to be challenging and <em>really</em> break it down step-by-step.
  This does mean that I may ask you to try something different from the way you have done it in the past.
  I might also ask you to think about things that you haven't really thought about much before.
  I hope you'll give it a shot: what do you have to lose by trying this subject in a new way?
  In fact, I encourage you to really think about the language used in mathematics.
  </p>

  <note>
    <p>
    Pay attention to the language of mathematics.
    </p>
  </note>

  <p>
  As an example of this, when writing <m>2^x</m> be sure to say one of the following:
  <ul>
  <li><q><m>2</m> to the <m>x</m></q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> to the <m>x</m>th power</q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> raised to the <m>x</m></q></li>
  <li><q><m>2</m> raised to the <m>x</m>th power</q></li>
  </ul>
  If we only say <q><m>2</m></q> then slightly pause to say <q><m>x</m></q> this focuses on the specific individual symbols.
  The bigger problem is that saying <q><m>2</m></q> followed by <q><m>x</m></q> is taken to mean <m>2x</m>.
  Why is this a problem?
  Because <m>2^x</m> and <m>2x</m> are not equal.
  In fact, when <m>x=3</m> then <m>2^x</m> simplifies to <m>8</m>, but <m>2x</m> simplifies to <m>6</m>.

		<title>Order of Operations</title>

    <p>
    We will take a little time to make sure that everyone is on the same page regarding the Order of Operations.
    Before we go any further, we should describe what we mean by an expression.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-expression">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>expression</term> is mathematical notation representing a number.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <aside>
      <p>
      An expression may consist of just a single constant such as <m>3</m> or <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>, 
      or can be a variable representing a number such as <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>, 
      or can be a combination of constants and variables connected by operations such as 
      addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <example>
      <p>
      Both <m>-40</m> and <m>\sqrt{23}</m> are examples of expressions. Both of these expressions are <em>constants</em>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
      Both <m>9x-8</m> and <m>x^2+3x+31</m> are examples of expressions which mention the variable <m>x</m>.
      In the first expression, the variable <m>x</m> is written once.
      In the second expression, the variable <m>x</m> is written twice.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
      The expression <m>x^2+2x+y^2-6y</m> mentions two variables.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
    Please note that an expression does not contain an equal sign. For example, <m>x^2+2x+y^2-6y=22</m> is not an expression.
    The notation that we just wrote instead states that one exrpession is equal to another expression.
    </p>

    <p>
    We need the Order of Operations because this it is easy to misinterpret an expression if we do not all agree on how to read expressions.
    The Order of Operations is a set of rules that tells us the order in which to evaluate (and more generally read) an expression. 
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-order-of-operations">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An expression must always be simplified and read by following the <term>Order of Operations</term>:
          <ol>
            <li>Parentheses</li>
            <li>Exponents</li>
            <li>Multiplication and Division (from left to right)</li>
            <li>Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <remark>
      <p>
      By the time we get to the third part of the Order of Operations, all exponents would have been evaluated.
      At this point, we look for any multiplication or division.
      If there is both multiplication and division, we evaluate them from left to right.
      It is not true that multiplication must be done before division.
      All divisions and multiplications that we see have the same level of precedence, and we evaluate them scanning from left to right in that order.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark>
      <p>
      Similarly, by the time we get to the last part of Order of Operations, all multiplications and divisions would have been handled.
      That means that what remains of our expressions should only have addition and subtraction operations remaining.
      These should be handled from left to right.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark>
      <p>
      The Order of Operations is sometimes remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.
      </p>

      <p>
      Because of the way that PEMDAS is often taught, many people mistakenly believe that multiplication must be done before division, and addition must be done before subtraction.
      This is not true.
      For this reason, some people prefer the acronym GEMA, which stands for Grouping symbols, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.
      In the acronym GEMA, the <q>G</q> is used to indicate that there are many kinds of grouping symbols, not just parentheses.
      Also, the multiplication and division are addressed together in the <q>M</q>, and addition and subtraction are addressed together in the <q>A</q>.
      </p>
    </remark>        

    <example xml:id="ex-expression-simplify">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Simplify the expression <m>5^2 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
        We will simplify the expression by following the Order of Operations.
        First, notice that there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next part of the Order of Operations.
        There is a place where the expression has exponens, so we zoom in on <m>5^2</m> and simplify this portion of the expression to <m>25</m>.
        So, the expression given to us becomes <m>25 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now there is no more exponents.
        Next, we look for any multiplication or division.
        We see both multiplication and division, so we evaluate them from left to right.
        The left-most multplication or division we see is the division <m>30 \div 3</m>, which simplifies to <m>10</m>.
        This gives us the expression <m>25 - 10 + 2 \cdot 6</m>.
        Continuing to scan from left to right for any multiplications or divisions, we see the multiplication <m>2 \cdot 6</m>, which simplifies to <m>12</m>.
        This gives us the expression <m>25 - 10 + 12</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now there are no more multiplications or divisions, we look for any additions or subtractions, starting from the left.
        The left-most addition or subtraction we see is the subtraction <m>25 - 10</m>, which simplifies to <m>15</m>.
        This gives us the expression <m>15 + 12</m>.
        Continuing to scan from left to right for any additions or subtractions, we see the addition <m>15 + 12</m>, which simplifies to <m>27</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Because this was our first example of applying the Order of Operations, we wanted to be very thorough to explain each step.
        To present our work, we start from the original expression and after writing an equal sign 
        (to indicate that what we will write next is equal) write a simplified version of the expression.
        We continue this process until we reach the final simplified expression. For this example, we have
        <m>5^2 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6 = 25 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6 = 25 - 10 + 2 \cdot 6 = 25 - 10 + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is also acceptable to write each expressions on their own lines, as follows:
        <md>
        <mrow>5^2 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6 \amp = 25 - 30 \div 3 + 2 \cdot 6</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 25 - 10 + 2 \cdot 6</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 25 - 10 + 12</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 15 + 12</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 27</mrow> 
        </md>
        Note that when presenting our work <em>vertically</em> we still include the equal signs to indicate 
        that each expression is equal to the previous expression.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

      When simplifying any expression, it is important to include equal signs to indicate that each expression is equal to the previous expression.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
      While simplifying expressions, ensure that the next expression you write is truly equal to the previous expression, instead of just writing the portion of the expression that is changing.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Simplify the expression <m>3 \cdot (6 - 4)^2 \div 2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
          <p>
          We can present our work horizontally, continuing to always write to the right of an equal sign like this <m>3 \cdot (6 - 4)^2 \div 2 = 3 \cdot 2^2 \div 2 = 3 \cdot 4 \div 2 = 12 \div 2 = 6</m>.
          </p>
      </solution>
      <solution>
          <p>
          We can instead present our work vertically
          <md>
          <mrow>3 \cdot (6 - 4)^2 \div 2 \amp = 3 \cdot 2^2 \div 2</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 3 \cdot 4 \div 2</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 12 \div 2</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 6</mrow> 
          </md>
          </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Simplify the expression <m>200 - 4^2 \div 8 \times 5 + 6</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          We can present our work horizontally, always writing to the right of the equal sign like this:
          <m>
          200 - 4^2 \div 8 \times 5 + 6 
          = 200 - 16 \div 8 \times 5 + 6 
          = 200 - 2 \times 5 + 6 
          = 200 - 10 + 6 
          = 190 + 6 
          = 196
          </m>.
        </p>
      </solution>

      <solution>
        <p>
          We can instead present our work vertically:
          <md>
            <mrow>200 - 4^2 \div 8 \times 5 + 6 \amp = 200 - 16 \div 8 \times 5 + 6</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 200 - 2 \times 5 + 6</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 200 - 10 + 6</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 190 + 6</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 196</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>




    <p>
    It is important for us to apply the Order of Operations not <em>only</em> to simplify expressions that contain only constants,
    but to also apply the Order of Operations when to interpret expressions that contain variables.
