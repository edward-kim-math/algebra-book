      Hello to <q>you</q> the student.
      As this course has evolved to support our computer science major, so has the text.  The current version of the book is intended to support  inquiry-based teaching for understanding that is so crucial for future teachers, while also providing the necessary mathematical foundation and application-based motivation for computer science students.  While teaching the course in Spring 2024 using an early version of this edition, I was pleasantly surprised by how many students reported that they, for the first time, saw how useful math could be in the <q>real world.</q>  I hope that this experience can be replicated in other classes using this text.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book is intended to be used in a class taught using problem-oriented or inquiry-based methods.  Each section begins with a preview of the content that includes an open-ended <em>Investigate!</em> motivating question, as well as a structured preview activity.  The preview activities are carefully scaffolded to provide an entry-point to the section's topic and to prime students to engage deeply in the material.  
      Depending on the pace of the class, I have found success assigning only the section preview before class, using the preview activity as in-class group work, or assigning the entire section to be read before class (each section concludes with a small set of reading questions that can be assigned to encourage students to actually read).  For those readers using this book for self-study, the organization of the sections will hopefully mimic the style of a rich inquiry-based classroom.
    </p>

    <title>How to Use This Book</title>

    <p>
      In addition to expository text, this book has a few features designed to encourage you to interact with the mathematics.
    </p>


    <paragraphs>
      <title><em>Investigate!</em> questions</title>

      <p>
        Sprinkled throughout the sections (usually at the very beginning of a topic) you will find open-ended questions designed to engage you with the topic soon to be discussed.
        You really should spend some time thinking about, or even working through, these problems before reading the section.  However, don't worry if you cannot find a satisfying solution right away.  The goal is to pique your interest, so you will read what is next looking for answers.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Preview Activities</title>
      <p>
        Most sections include a structured preview activity.  These contain leading questions that you should be able to completely answer before reading the section.  The idea is that the questions prime you to engage meaningfully with the new content ahead.  If you are using the online version, most of these questions will provide you with immediate feedback so you can be confident moving forward.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Examples</title>

      <p>
        I have tried to include the <q>correct</q> number of examples.
        For those examples that include <em>problems</em>, full solutions are included.
        Before reading the solution, try to at least have an understanding of what the problem is asking.
        Unlike some textbooks, the examples are not meant to be all-inclusive for problems you will see in the exercises.
        They should not be used as a blueprint for solving other problems.
        Instead, use the examples to deepen your understanding of the concepts and techniques discussed in each section.
        Then use this understanding to solve the exercises at the end of each section.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Exercises</title>

      <p>
        You get good at math through practice.
        Each section concludes with practice problems meant to solidify concepts and basic skills presented in that section; the online version provides immediate feedback on these problems.  There are then additional exercises that are more challenging and open-ended.  These might be assigned as written homework or used in class as group work.  Some of the additional exercises have hints or solutions in the back of the book, but use these as little as possible.  Struggle is good for you.  
        At the end of each chapter, a larger collection of similar exercises is included (as a sort of <q>chapter review</q>) which might bridge the material of different sections in that chapter.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Interactive Online Version</title>

      <p>
        For those of you reading this in print or as a PDF, I encourage you to also check out the interactive online version.  Many of the preview activities and exercises are interactive and can give you immediate feedback.  Some of these have randomized components, allowing you to practice many similar versions of the same problems until you master the topic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hints and solutions to examples are also hidden away behind an extra click to encourage you to think about the problem before reading the solution.  There is a good search feature available as well, and the index has expandable links to see the content without jumping to the page immediately.  There is also a python scratch pad (the pencil icon) so you can try out some code if you feel so inclined.
      </p>

        <p>
        Additional interactivity is planned.
        These <q>bonus</q> features will be added on a rolling basis, so keep an eye out!
      </p>
