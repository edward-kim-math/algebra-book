  <title>Peer Instruction Questions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p> This appendix contains a collection of multiple choice questions focusing on the concepts from each section in the textbook. These are provided to facilitate in-class discussion and peer instruction using the Runestone peer instruction feature. Ideally, the instructor will present the question to all students at once, who will select the answer they believe to be most appropriate. Once everyone has submitted their answers, students can discuss why they believe their answers are correct with neighbors or randomly selected students through Runestone. After a few minutes of discussion, students should vote again for the correct answer. The instructor should then lead a discussion of the correct answer and why it is correct. </p>
