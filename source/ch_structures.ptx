  <title>Discrete Structures Revisited</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Throughout the previous chapters, we have seen many examples of discrete structures and their properties and uses.  The following sections are  self-contained overviews of each of the main structures we have explored. These can either be studied prior to other material in the book or as a review and reference after the fact.
