				A <term>mini sudoku puzzle</term> is a <m>4\times 4</m> grid of squares, divided into four <m>2\times 2</m> boxes.
				The goal is to fill each square with a digit from 1 to 4, such that no digit repeats in any row, any column, or any box.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here is a simple mini sudoku puzzle you can try to solve.

				The goal of this <em>Investigate!</em> question is to prove that this is not a coincidence:  Suppose a mini sudoku puzzle has all different numbers in its four corners (marked with # below).
				Prove that the center four squares (marked with * below) must also contain different numbers.

			<idx><h>Goldbach</h></idx>
			Anyone who doesn't believe there is creativity in mathematics clearly has not tried to write proofs.
			Finding a way to convince the world that a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and can often be quite challenging.
			There is no guaranteed path to success in the search for proofs.
			For example, in the summer of 1742, a German mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes.
			Centuries later, we still don't have a proof of this apparent fact (computers have checked that Goldbach's conjecture holds for all numbers less than <m>4\times 10^{18}</m>, but no proof that the statement holds for <em>all</em> numbers has been found).
		</p>

		<p>
			Writing proofs is a bit of an art.
			Like any art, to be truly great at it, you need some sort of inspiration, as well as some foundational technique.
			Just as musicians can learn proper fingering, and painters can learn the proper way to hold a brush, we can look at the proper way to construct arguments.
			<!-- A good place to start might be to study a classic.

		<theorem>
			<statement>
				<p>
					There are infinitely many primes.
					<idx> <h>prime numbers</h> </idx>
				</p>
			</statement>
		</theorem>
		--> <!--
		<proof>
			<p>
				Suppose this were not the case.
				That is, suppose there are only finitely many primes.
				Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it <m>p</m>.
				Consider the number
				<me>
					N = p! + 1 = (p \cdot (p-1) \cdot \cdots 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 1
				</me>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now <m>N</m> is certainly larger than <m>p</m>.
				Also, <m>N</m> is not divisible by any number less than or equal to <m>p</m>, since every number less than or equal to <m>p</m> divides <m>p!</m>.
				Thus the prime factorization of <m>N</m> contains prime numbers (possibly just <m>N</m> itself) all greater than <m>p</m>.
				So <m>p</m> is not the largest prime, a contradiction.
				Therefore there are infinitely many primes.
			</p>
		</proof>

		<p>
			This proof is an example of a <em>proof by contradiction</em>, one of the standard styles of mathematical proof.
			First and foremost, the proof is an argument.
			It contains sequence of statements, the last being the <em>conclusion</em> which follows from the previous statements.
			The argument is valid so the conclusion must be true if the premises are true.
			Let's go through the proof line by line.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Suppose there are only finitely many primes.
						<em>[this is a premise.
						Note the use of <q>suppose.</q>]</em>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						There must be a largest prime, call it <m>p</m>.
						<em>[follows from line 1, by the definition of <q>finitely many.</q>]</em>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						Let <m>N = p! + 1</m>.
						<em>[basically just notation, although this is the inspired part of the proof; looking at <m>p! + 1</m> is the key insight.]</em>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<m>N</m> is larger than <m>p</m>. <em>[by the definition of <m>p!</m>]</em>
				</li>

				<li>
					<m>N</m> is not divisible by any number less than or equal to <m>p</m> . <em>[by definition, <m>p!</m> is divisible by each number less than or equal to <m>p</m>, so <m>p! + 1</m> is not.]</em>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						The prime factorization of <m>N</m> contains prime numbers greater than <m>p</m>.
						<em>[since <m>N</m> is divisible by each prime number in the prime factorization of <m>N</m>, and by line 5.]</em>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						Therefore <m>p</m> is not the largest prime.
						<em>[by line 6, <m>N</m> is divisible by a prime larger than <m>p</m>.]</em>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						This is a contradiction.
						<em>[from line 2 and line 7: the largest prime is <m>p</m> and there is a prime larger than <m>p</m>.]</em>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						Therefore there are infinitely many primes.
						<em>[from line 1 and line 8: our only premise lead to a contradiction, so the premise is false.]</em>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>
			We should say a bit more about the last line.
			Up through line 8, we have a valid argument with the premise <q>there are only finitely many primes</q> and the conclusion <q>there is a prime larger than the largest prime.</q> This is a valid argument as each line follows from previous lines.
			So if the premises are true, then the conclusion <em>must</em> be true.
			However, the conclusion is NOT true.
			The only way out: the premise must be false.
		</p>

		<p>
			The sort of line-by-line analysis we did above is a great way to really understand what is going on.
			Whenever you come across a proof in a textbook, you really should make sure you understand what each line is saying and why it is true.
		</p>
		-->
		<p>
			We can view a proof through two distinct but intersecting lenses.
			First, we can think about the <em>logical</em> structure of a proof.
			Below we will consider three styles of proof that vary precisely in their logical structure.
			Second, we can look at the <em>mathematical content</em> of the proof.
			How does the proof illustrate understanding of mathematical concepts?  Does it use definitions of mathematical objects correctly?  How do the definitions interact with each other?
		</p>

		<p>
			<idx><h>tautology</h></idx>
			Recall that in <xref ref="sec_logic-rules"/> we said that a <term>tautology</term> is a necessarily true statement, but that it doesn't tell us anything interesting.
			Similarly, if a proof relied entirely on the logical form of the statement it was proving, it wouldn't tell us anything interesting about mathematics.
			Thus all the proofs we consider <em>must</em> involve some combining of mathematical concepts in addition to their logical structure.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this section, we will see examples of how the interaction between logical and mathematical structure plays out.
			We will think of the logical structure as the <em>skeleton</em> or <em>scaffolding</em> of the proof and look at the different shapes this skeleton can take.
			We will then see how the mathematical content of the proof fills in the details of the skeleton, how it adds meat to the bones.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is often challenging to be careful about proofs when the statements we try to prove seem too obvious or familiar.
			While we will definitely want to prove simple facts about numbers, like that the sum of two even numbers is even, our familiarity with numbers can make it difficult to take this task seriously.
			So instead, we will start by proving some facts in what is hopefully a novel setting: mini sudoku puzzles.

		<title>Direct Proof</title>

		<idx> <h>direct proof</h> </idx>
		<p>
			The simplest style of proof is <term>direct proof</term>.
			Often all that is required to prove something is a systematic explanation of what everything means.
			You look at the definitions, carefully explain and <em>unpack</em> their meaning, until you see that the conclusion is true.
		</p>

		<p>
			To illustrate the importance of definitions in a proof, let's give a few careful definitions about mini sudoku puzzles.
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="def-mini-sudoku">
			<title>Mini Sudoku Definitions</title>
			<idx><h>sudoku</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A <term>mini sudoku puzzle</term> is a partially filled in <m>4\times 4</m> grid of squares, divided into four <m>2\times 2</m> boxes.
					Each square can be empty or contain a digit from 1 to 4.
				</p>

				<p>
					We say that a mini sudoku puzzle is <term>valid</term> provided no digit from 1 to 4 appears more than once in any row, any column, or any box.
				</p>

				<p>
					A <term>solution</term> to a mini sudoku puzzle is a valid puzzle with no empty squares and every non-empty square of the puzzle unchanged.
				</p>

				<p>
					We say that a mini sudoku puzzle is <term>solvable</term> if there is exactly one solution.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			First, let's prove a useful and <q>obvious</q> fact about any valid mini sudoku puzzle.
		</p>


		<proposition xml:id="prop-mini-sudoku-full">
			<statement>
				<p>
					Any solution to a mini sudoku puzzle will have each digit from 1 to 4 appear exactly once in each row, in each column, and in each box, appearing a total of four times.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</proposition>

		<p>
			That's obvious, you say!  Isn't that exactly what a valid puzzle is?  Well, a valid completed puzzle, which is what we mean by a solution, right?  Okay, not exactly, since valid means that no digit repeats...
			isn't that the same thing?
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes!  Exactly! Saying this is a direct proof.
		</p>


		<proof>
			<p>
				Suppose you have a solution to a mini sudoku puzzle.
				That means that you have a <m>4 \times 4</m> grid with each square filled in with a digit from 1 to 4 that is valid.<fn>Definition of <term>solution</term></fn> Since the puzzle is <em>valid</em>, no digit repeats in any row, any column, or any box<fn>Definition of <term>valid</term></fn>.
				Since a row contains four numbers that do not repeat, and there are exactly four possible digits, each of those digits must appear exactly once.
				This is true for every row, and for every column, and for every box.
			</p>

			<p>
				For each digit, since it appears exactly once in four different rows, it appears exactly four times.
				This completes the proof.
			</p>
		</proof>

		<remark>
			<p>
				The proof contained one key mathematical idea besides just explaining definitions: If four distinct numbers are chosen from a set of four numbers, then all four numbers are chosen.
				Perhaps you want to also explain why this is true, or just say it is an example of the pigeonhole principle (we will say what this is soon).
				How much you explain depends on who you are writing the proof for.
				A little paranoia when writing proofs is healthy.
			</p>

			<p>
				Indeed, in most contexts, we wouldn't even need to write out any of the above proof.
				It would probably be sufficient to say, <q>Clearly this follows from the definitions.</q>  However, we are currently trying to learn how to write proofs, and it can be useful to be overly pedantic so we can focus on the proof structure and the importance of applying definitions.
			</p>
		</remark>

		<p>
			Let's prove something about a particular sudoku puzzle.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Prove that for any solution to the mini sudoku puzzle below, if the solution has a 2 in the top-left square (r1c1), then it will contain a 2 in the bottom-right square (r4c4).
				</p>

				<image width="25%">
					<shortdescription>
						A mini sudoku puzzle.
					</shortdescription>
					<latex-image label="img-sudoku-first-proof">
						\begin{tikzpicture}
							\sudokuFour{
								~,1,3,~,
								~,~,~,1,
								~,~,~,3,
								~,~,~,~
							}
						\end{tikzpicture}
					</latex-image>
				</image>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					We do not know whether the puzzle is solvable (in fact, it is not), although note that it is valid right now.
					What we want to prove is that <em>if</em> 2 is in the top-left square in any particular solution, <em>then</em> that solution contains a 2 in the bottom-right square.
				</p>


				<proof>
					<p>
						Let <m>S</m> be a solution to the puzzle, and assume that <m>S</m> contains a 2 in the top-left square.
						Since <m>S</m> is a valid puzzle, no digit repeats in any row, any column, or any box.
						Look first at the top row.
						Since the row already contains 1, 2, and 3, the remaining open square (r1c4) must be a 4.
					</p>

					<p>
						Now look at column 4 (the right-most column).
						Since we now know the top-right square is a 4, this column already contains 1, 3, and 4.
						So the last open square (r4c4) must be a 2.
					</p>

					<p>
						Thus <m>S</m> contains a 2 in the bottom-right square, which is what we needed to prove.
					</p>
				</proof>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Observe the general form of the argument above.
			We were trying to prove an implication <m>P \imp Q</m>: If there was a 2 in r1c1, then there was a 2 in r4c4.
			We started by assuming <m>P</m> was true.
			From that, we deduced something, and from that something we deduced <m>Q</m>.
			This is exactly what a direct proof of an implication <m>P \imp Q</m> looks like (we could have had more steps between the <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> as well).
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Assume <m>P</m>.
				Explain, explain, <ellipsis />, explain.
				Therefore <m>Q</m>.
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			<idx><h>arbitrary</h></idx>
			The one additional consideration we must make is that often we are proving a general, universal statement, a statement of the form <m>\forall x (P(x) \imp Q(x))</m>.
			To handle the quantifier, we fix an <em>arbitrary</em> instance of <m>x</m>.
			Above, we said, <q>Let <m>S</m> be a solution to the puzzle.</q>  Since we made no additional assumptions about <m>S</m> besides that <m>P</m> was true about it, we say that <m>S</m> was an <em>arbitrary</em> solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			If we wanted to prove that all squares are rectangles, we first realize that this is the same as saying, <q>For any shape, if the shape is a square, then it is a rectangle.</q>  In symbols, <m>\forall x (S(x) \imp R(x))</m>.
			We will want to assume <m>P(x)</m> is true and deduce <m>Q(x)</m>.
			Which <m>x</m> do we use?  An arbitrary one, so our proof can be applied to <em>all</em> possible <m>x</m>.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Prove that for any mini sudoku puzzle with three empty squares, if the puzzle has a solution, then the puzzle is solvable.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Is this obvious?  If a puzzle has a solution, then it is solvable, right?  Not at all!  Look again at the <xref ref="def-mini-sudoku" text="title"/>: Just because a puzzle has a solution doesn't mean that it has exactly one solution (i.e.,
					it is solvable).
					But even if we don't think this needs a proof, let's be paranoid again and use this as an excuse to focus on the logical structure of the proof.
				</p>

				<p>
					Notice that we are proving that the claim is true no matter what mini sudoku puzzle we start with.
					We might start with this puzzle:
				</p>

				<image width="25%">
					<shortdescription>
						4x4 sudoku with only one missing digit.
					</shortdescription>
					<latex-image label="img-sudoku-almost-done-eg">
						\begin{tikzpicture}
							\sudokuFour{
								3,~,4,2,
								2,4,3,1,
								1,~,~,4,
								4,2,1,3
							}
						\end{tikzpicture}
					</latex-image>
				</image>

				<p>
					Clearly there is only one way to complete the puzzle: The top row has only one open square, so we can only put one digit in it, and then columns 2 and 3 only have one open square each, so we can fill those uniquely.
				</p>

				<p>
					Looking at a single example can often be helpful when crafting a proof, but proving a general statement with an example is <alert>NEVER</alert> a correct proof.
				</p>

				<p>
					While there are <em>only</em> around 152.58 billion mini sudoku puzzles (and most of those are not valid, fewer have solutions, and even fewer have exactly one empty square), we don't really want to check all possible puzzles.
					So instead, we fix an arbitrary valid mini sudoku puzzle.
					We assume that it has a solution and has exactly three open squares.
					From this, we prove that there is only one possible solution.
				</p>


				<proof>
					<p>
						Let <m>P</m> be an arbitrary mini sudoku puzzle.
						Assume <m>P</m> has exactly three empty squares and that <m>S</m> is a solution.
					</p>
						
					<p>
						Since <m>P</m> is arbitrary, we don't know how the three empty squares are arranged.  They could all be in different rows, or two could be in the same row, or all three could be in the same row.  
					</p>

					<p>
						If all the empty squares are in different rows, then in each row, there is exactly one empty square.  The other three squares are filled with three different digits (since the puzzle is valid), so there is only one choice to fill the empty square.  This number must be the number used in the solution <m>S</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Now consider the case where two of the empty squares are in the same row, and the third square is in a different row.  The third empty square's row has three different digits, so there is only one choice for the last square, and it must agree with <m>S</m>.  Once this is filled in, the other two empty squares must be in two different columns, each of which has three filled-in digits.  In each of these columns, the three filled-in digits are different, so there is only one choice for the empty square.  So again, any solution must be exactly <m>S</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, if all three empty squares are in the same row, then they are all in different columns.  So using the same argument as we did when the empty squares were in different rows, but using columns instead, we see that <m>S</m> is the only solution.
					</p>

					<p>
						We have considered all possible cases, and in each case, <m>S</m> is the only solution, so <m>P</m> is solvable.
					</p>
				</proof>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Direct proof can, of course, be used to prove statements in mathematics too.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="eg-logic-proofs-sqr-even-even">

				<p>
					Prove: For all integers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is even, then <m>n^2</m> is even.
				</p>

			<solution>
				<p>
					The format of the proof will be this: Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer.
					Assume that <m>n</m> is even.
					Explain explain explain.
					Therefore <m>n^2</m> is even.
				</p>

				<p>
					To fill in the details, we explain what it means for <m>n</m> to be even, and then see what that means for <m>n^2</m>.
					The <em>definition</em> that is relevant here is, <q>An integer <m>n</m> is <term>even</term> if there is an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>n = 2k</m>.</q> Here is a complete proof.
				</p>


				<proof>
					<p>
						Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer.
						Suppose <m>n</m> is even.
						Then <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
						Now <m>n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)</m>.
						Since <m>2k^2</m> is an integer, <m>n^2</m> is even.

				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Even if we don't remember exactly what <q>is a multiple of</q> means, we can set up a direct proof for this statement.
					It will go something like this: Let <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> be arbitrary integers.
					Assume that <m>b</m> is a multiple of <m>a</m> and that <m>c</m> is a multiple of <m>b</m>.
					Dot dot dot.
					Therefore <m>c</m> is a multiple of <m>a</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					How do we connect the dots? We say what our hypothesis really means and why this gives us what the conclusion really means.
					This is where we need the definition of <term><m>b</m> is a multiple of <m>a</m></term>: This means that <m>b = ka</m> for some integers <m>k</m>.
					What are we going for? That <m>c = la</m>, for some integer <m>l</m>.
					Here is the complete proof.

				<proof>
					<p>
						Let <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> be integers.
						Assume that <m>b</m> is a multiple of <m>a</m> and that <m>c</m> is a multiple of <m>b</m>.
						So there are integers <m>k</m> and <m>j</m> such that <m>b = ka</m> and <m>c = jb</m>.
						Combining these (through substitution) we get that

		<p>
			Recall that an implication <m>P \imp Q</m> is logically equivalent to its contrapositive <m>\neg Q \imp \neg P</m>.
			There are plenty of examples of statements that are hard to prove directly, but whose contrapositive can easily be proved using a direct proof.
			This is all that <term>proof by contrapositive</term> does.
			It gives a direct proof of the contrapositive of the implication.
			This is enough because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.

						This means that in at least one row, or one column, or one box, some digit appears more than once.
					</p>

					<p>
						Now suppose we have filled in the empty squares but not changed any previously filled-in squares.
						The original row, column, or box that contained a duplicate digit will still contain that duplication, so the resulting completed puzzle will not be valid.
						Thus no solution to <m>P</m> exists, so <m>P</m> is not solvable.
					</p>
				</proof>

				<p>
					We have proved that if a mini sudoku puzzle is not valid, then it is not solvable, which is the contrapositive of what we wanted to prove and so serves as a proof of the original statement.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Here are a couple more mathy examples.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Is the statement, <q>For all integers <m>n</m>, if <m>n^2</m> is even, then <m>n</m> is even,</q> true?
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					This is the converse of the statement we proved in <xref ref="eg-logic-proofs-sqr-even-even"/> above using a direct proof.
					From trying a few examples, this statement appears to be true.
					So let's prove it.
				</p>

				<p>
					A direct proof of this statement would require fixing an arbitrary <m>n</m> and assuming that <m>n^2</m> is even.
					But it is not at all clear how this would allow us to conclude anything about <m>n</m>.
					Just because <m>n^2 = 2k</m> does not in itself suggest how we could write <m>n</m> as a multiple of 2.
				</p>

				<p>
					Try something else: Write the contrapositive of the statement.
					We get, for all integers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is odd, then <m>n^2</m> is odd.
					This looks much more promising.
				</p>

				<p>
					We need a definition of a number being odd. An integer <m>n</m> is <term>odd</term> provided <m>n = 2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
					Our proof will look something like this:
				</p>

				<p>
					Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer.
					Suppose that <m>n</m> is not even.
					This means that <ellipsis />.
					In other words <ellipsis />.
					But this is the same as saying <ellipsis />.
					Therefore <m>n^2</m> is not even.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now we fill in the details.
				</p>


				<proof>
					<p>
						We will prove the contrapositive.
						Let <m> n</m> be an arbitrary integer.
						Suppose that <m>n</m> is not even, and thus odd.
						Then <m>n= 2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
						Now <m>n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1</m>.
						Since <m>2k^2 + 2k</m> is an integer, we see that <m>n^2</m> is odd and therefore not even.
					</p>
				</proof>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Prove that for all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, if <m>a + b</m> is odd, then <m>a</m> is odd or <m>b</m> is odd.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					The problem with trying a direct proof is that it will be hard to separate <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> from knowing something about <m>a+b</m>.
					On the other hand, if we know something about <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> separately, then combining them might give us information about <m>a+b</m>.
					The contrapositive of the statement we are trying to prove is: for all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are even, then <m>a+b</m> is even.
					Thus our proof will have the following format:
				</p>

				<p>
					Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers.
					Assume that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both even.
					la la la.
					Therefore <m>a+b</m> is even.
				</p>

				<p>
					Here is a complete proof.
				</p>


				<proof>
					<p>
						Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers.
						Assume that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are even.
						Then <m>a = 2k</m> and <m>b = 2l</m> for some integers <m>k</m> and <m>l</m>.
						Now <m>a + b = 2k + 2l = 2(k+l)</m>.
						Since <m>k + l</m> is an integer, we see that <m>a + b</m> is even, completing the proof.
					</p>
				</proof>

				<p>
					Note that our assumption that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are even is the negation of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is odd.
					We used De Morgan's law here.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Direct proofs and proofs by contrapositive can be used when proving <em>implications</em>.
			Remember that some statements that are not explicitly written as an implication can be rephrased as one.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the statement, <q>For every prime number <m>p</m>, either <m>p = 2</m>, or <m>p</m> is odd.</q>
					We can rephrase this as, <q>For every prime number <m>p</m>, if <m>p \ne 2</m>, then <m>p</m> is odd.</q>
					Now try to prove it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Use the following as the definition of a prime number: An integer <m>p \gt 1</m> is <term>prime</term> provided it has exactly two factors, namely <m>1</m> and <m>p</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<proof>
					<p>
						Let <m>p</m> be an arbitrary prime number.
						Assume <m>p</m> is not odd.
						So <m>p</m> is divisible by 2.
						Since <m>p</m> is prime, it must have exactly two divisors, and it has 2 as a divisor, so <m>p</m> must be divisible by only 1 and 2.
						Therefore <m>p = 2</m>.
						This completes the proof (by contrapositive).
					</p>
				</proof>

		<title>Proof by Contradiction</title>

		<idx> <h>contradiction</h> </idx>
		<idx> <h>proof</h> <h>by contradiction</h> </idx>
		<p>
			Take a step back and consider what it would mean if the conclusion of an argument were false.
			There are two reasons this could happen.
			Either the logic in the argument is faulty, or at least one assumption must be false.
			A <term>proof by contradiction</term> exploits this second possibility.
			We start with a single assumption and construct a <em>valid</em> proof that leads to a false conclusion; the only possibility is that the single assumption was false.
			The false conclusion is the <q>contradiction,</q> which just means a necessarily false statement (technically a statement of the form <m>P \wedge \neg P</m>).
		</p>

		<p>
			The general form of a proof by contradiction to prove a statement <m>P</m> is,
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Assume <m>\neg P</m> (that <m>P</m> is not true).
				This means that..., which tells us..., so we can say...
				But that is a contradiction, so <m>P</m> must in fact be true.
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			Note that if we think of this style of argument as a direct proof of something, it is a direct proof of
			<me>
				\neg P \imp \text{ contradiction}
			</me>.
			So we have a valid proof of this implication.
			How can a true implication have a false conclusion?  Recall the truth table for an implication (<xref ref="fig-implication-tt"/>).
			The only row in which the implication is true but the conclusion is false is row 4, and here the hypothesis is also false.
			So <m>\neg P</m> is false, which is to say <m>P</m> is true.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once you start writing proofs by contradiction, it becomes very natural.
			Let's see how with a sudoku proof.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Prove that any solution to the mini sudoku puzzle below must contain a 3 in the top-right corner (r1c4).
				</p>

				<image width="25%">
					<shortdescription>
						4x4 sudoku puzzle.

								~,3,~,~,
								3,~,~,~,
								~,~,~,1
							}
						\end{tikzpicture}
					</latex-image>
				</image>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					There are multiple ways we could prove this, which is often the case for proofs by contradiction.
					While we would always start with the same initial assumption (the opposite of what we want to prove), where the contradiction is found can vary.
				</p>


				<proof>
					<p>
						Let <m>S</m> be a solution to the puzzle, but assume that <m>S</m> does <em>not</em> contain a 3 in the top-right corner.
						Then the top row must contain a 3 somewhere else.
						It cannot be in column 1, since it already has a 3.
						It cannot be in column 2, since that square is already filled in (with the 2).
						It also cannot be in column 3, since if it was, there would be no place to put a three in the bottom row.
						So there would be no 3 in the top row, contradicting that <m>S</m> is a solution.
					</p>

					<p>
						Therefore <m>S</m> must contain a 3 in the top-right corner.
					</p>
				</proof>
			</solution>

					</latex-image>
				</image>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Look at the logical format of this statement: <me>\neg \exists S (S \text{ is a solution })</me>.  Using the rules for negation of quantifiers, this is the same as <me>\forall S (S \text{ is not a solution})</me>.
					If we were to prove this directly, we would need to consider all possible solutions and show that they are not valid.  That seems quite challenging.
				</p>

				<p>
					On the other hand, if we try a proof by contradiction, we get to assume the negation of the statement we are asked to prove.  That is, we can assume that there <em>is</em> a solution.  That is a single solution we can reason about.  Much more manageable.
				</p>

				<proof>
					<p>
						Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there <em>does</em> exist a solution to the puzzle.  This solution must have a 4 in the bottom-left box.  But the only squares that can hold a 4 are either in row 4 or column 1 (or both).  In either case, this contradicts that there is a 4 already in column 1 and row 4.  
					</p>
				</proof>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Here are three examples of proofs by contradiction about numbers:
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Prove that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<proof>
					<p>
						Suppose not.
						Then <m>\sqrt 2</m> is equal to a fraction <m> \frac{a}{b}</m>.
						Without loss of generality, assume <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is in lowest terms (otherwise reduce the fraction).
						So,
						<me>
							2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
						</me>
						<me>
							2b^2 = a^2
						</me>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Thus <m>a^2</m> is even, and as such <m>a</m> is even.
						So <m>a = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>, and <m>a^2 = 4k^2</m>.
						We then have,
						<me>
							2b^2 = 4k^2
						</me>
						<me>
							b^2 = 2k^2
						</me>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Thus <m>b^2</m> is even, and as such <m>b</m> is even.
						Since <m>a</m> is also even, we see that <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is not in lowest terms, a contradiction.
						Thus <m>\sqrt 2</m> is irrational.
					</p>
				</proof>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Prove: There are no integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>x^2 = 4y + 2</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<proof>
					<p>
						We proceed by contradiction.
						So suppose there <em>are</em> integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>x^2 = 4y + 2 = 2(2y + 1)</m>.
						So <m>x^2</m> is even.
						We have seen that this implies that <m>x</m> is even.
						So <m>x = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
						Then <m>x^2 = 4k^2</m>.
						This in turn gives <m>2k^2 = (2y + 1)</m>.
						But <m>2k^2</m> is even, and <m>2y + 1</m> is odd, so these cannot be equal.
						Thus we have a contradiction, so there must not be any integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>x^2 = 4y + 2</m>.
					</p>
				</proof>
			</solution>

			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>Pigeonhole Principle</term>:
					<idx> <h>pigeonhole principle</h> </idx>
					If more than <m>n</m> pigeons fly into <m>n</m> pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole will contain at least two pigeons.
					Prove this!
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<proof>
					<p>
						Suppose, contrary to stipulation, that each of the pigeonholes contains at most one pigeon.
						Then at most, there will be <m>n</m> pigeons.
						But we assumed that there are more than <m>n</m> pigeons, so this is impossible.
						Thus there must be a pigeonhole with more than one pigeon.
					</p>
				</proof>

				<p>
					While we phrased this proof as a proof by contradiction, we could have also used a proof by contrapositive since our contradiction was simply the negation of the hypothesis.
					Sometimes this will happen, in which case you can use either style of proof.

		<title>Summary of Proof Styles</title>

		<p>
			We have considered three styles of proof: direct proof, proof by contrapositive, and proof by contradiction.
			It can be challenging to decide which style of proof to use on a given problem, and no rule will always tell us what to do.
			Often, there are multiple ways you can proceed in a proof, which is one reason math is so exciting.
		</p>

		<p>
			A good starting point when writing proofs is to consider what the initial assumption would be with each style, and what the conclusion you would be looking for is.
			A proof is a little like a kids-menu maze.
			There is a <em>START</em> and an <em>EXIT</em>, and your goal is to find your way from one to the other.
			Sometimes it helps to work your way in from both sides and hopefully meet in the middle.

			You can use a proof by contradiction even if you are not trying to prove an implication, but if the statement is an implication, then assuming <m>\neg (P \imp Q)</m> is really powerful.
			Remember, the only way for an implication to be false is for <m>P</m> to be true and <m>Q</m> to be false.

			Aha!  <m>P</m> is what we assume in a direct proof.
			<m>\neg Q</m> is what we assume in a proof by contrapositive.
			So a <em>proof by contradiction is like doing the other two proofs at the same time, and meeting in the middle!</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			To illustrate this, let's prove the fact from the <em>Investigate!</em> activity.
			We will prove that if a mini sudoku puzzle has all different numbers in its corners (marked with <m>a</m> through <m>d</m> below), then the center four squares (marked with * below) must also contain different numbers (in any solution).

			</latex-image>
		</image>

		<p>
			We will give three proofs, first a direct proof, then a proof by contrapositive, and finally a proof by contradiction.
		</p>


		<proof>
			<p>
				Let <m>P</m> be a sudoku puzzle with all different numbers in its corners: <m>a</m> in the top-left, <m>b</m> in the top-right, <m>c</m> in the bottom-left, and <m>d</m> in the bottom-right.
				Let <m>S</m> be any solution to the puzzle.
			</p>

			<p>
				In <m>S</m>, whatever digit <m>a</m> is must appear in row 2.
				Since <m>a</m> is already in the top-left box, it cannot appear in columns 1 or 2, so it must appear in columns 3 or 4.
				If it is in column 3, then <m>a</m> appears in one of the center squares.
				If not, then it is in column 4.
				In this latter case, we ask where <m>a</m> appears in row 3: It cannot be in column 1 or 4, so it must be in column 2 or 3, and thus in one of the center squares.
			</p>

			<p>
				The same argument can now be applied to each of the other three outer squares.
				Thus, in any solution to the puzzle, the center four squares must contain the digits <m>a</m> through <m>d</m>, all different.
			</p>
		</proof>

		<p>
			Now we will prove the same statement by contrapositive.
		</p>


		<proof>
			<p>
				Let <m>P</m> be a mini sudoku puzzle with numbers in its corners.
				Let <m>S</m> be any solution to the puzzle.
				Assume that the center four squares do not contain all different numbers in <m>S</m>.
				Then there must be some common number, say <m>n</m>, in two of the center squares.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since <m>n</m> cannot appear twice in a row, it must be that <m>n</m> is in two center squares diagonally from each other: either in r2c2 and r3c3, or in r2c3 and r3c2.
				In either case, where could <m>n</m> be in rows 1 and 4?  It cannot be in columns 2 or 3, so it must be in columns 1 and 4.
				This means that <m>n</m> will be in opposite outer corners, meaning that the digits in the four corners are not all different.
			</p>
		</proof>

		<p>
			Finally, we will prove the same statement by contradiction.
		</p>


		<proof>
			<p>
				Let <m>P</m> be a mini sudoku puzzle and assume that the four outer corners are all different, but in some solution <m>S</m>, the center four squares are not all different.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suppose <m>a</m>, the digit in the top-left corner, appears twice in the center four squares.
				The only way this can happen is if <m>a</m> appears in r3c2 and r2c3, as shown below.
			</p>

			<image width="25%">
				<shortdescription>

								~,*,$a$,~,
								~,$a$,*,~,
								$c$, , ,$d$
							}
						\end{tikzpicture}
				</latex-image>
			</image>

			<p>
				But now, where can the fourth <m>a</m> in the go in the solution?  It must be in r4c4, contradicting that the four corners are all different.
				An analogous argument leads to a contradiction for each of the other possible outer corner digits being repeated in the center.
				Thus, the center four squares must contain all different numbers.

		<title>Proof by (counter) Example</title>

		<idx> <h>counterexample</h> </idx>
		<p>
			It is almost NEVER okay to prove a statement with just an example.
			Certainly none of the statements proved above can be proved through an example.
			This is because in each of those cases we are trying to prove that something holds of <u>all</u> integers.
			We claim that <m>n^2</m> being even implies that <m>n</m> is even, <em>no matter what integer</em> <m>n</m> we pick.
			Showing that this works for <m>n = 4</m> is not even close to enough.
		</p>

		<p>
			This cannot be stressed enough.
			If you are trying to prove a statement of the form <m>\forall x P(x)</m>, you absolutely CANNOT prove this with an example.<fn> This is not to say that looking at examples is a waste of time.
			Doing so will often give you an idea of how to write a proof.
			But the examples do not belong in the proof.
			</fn>
		</p>

		<p>
			However, existential statements can be proven this way.
			If we want to prove that there is an integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n^2-n+41</m> is not prime, all we need to do is find one.
			This might seem like a silly thing to want to prove until you try a few values for <m>n</m>.

			So far we have gotten only primes.
			You might be tempted to conjecture, <q>For all positive integers <m>n</m>, the number <m>n^2 - n + 41</m> is prime.</q> If you wanted to prove this, you would need to use a direct proof, a proof by contrapositive, or another style of proof, but certainly it is not enough to give even 7 examples.
			In fact, we can prove this conjecture is <em> false</em> by proving its negation: <q>There is a positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n^2 - n + 41</m> is not prime.</q> Since this is an existential statement, it suffices to show that there does indeed exist such a number.
		</p>

		<p>
			In fact, we can quickly see that <m>n = 41</m> will give <m>41^2</m> which is certainly not prime.
			You might say that this is a counterexample to the conjecture that <m>n^2 - n + 41</m> is always prime.
			Since so many statements in mathematics are universal, making their negations existential, we can often prove that a statement is false (if it is) by providing a counterexample.

				<p>
					As the negation passed by the quantifiers, they changed from <m>\forall</m> to <m>\exists</m>.
					We then needed to take the negation of an implication, which is equivalent to asserting the if part and not the then part.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now we know what to do.
					To prove that the converse is false we need to find two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> so that <m>a</m> is odd or <m>b</m> is odd, but <m>a+b</m> is not odd (so even).
					That's easy: 1 and 3.
					(remember, <q>or</q> means one or the other or both).
					Both of these are odd, but <m>1+3 = 4</m> is not odd.

		<title>Proof by Cases</title>

		<p>
			We could go on and on and on about different proof styles (we will discuss combinatorial proofs and proofs by induction in later sections), but instead we will end with one final useful technique: proof by cases.
			The idea is to prove that <m>P</m> is true by proving that <m>Q \imp P</m> and <m>\neg Q \imp P</m> for some statement <m>Q</m>.
			So no matter what, whether or not <m>Q</m> is true, we know that <m>P</m> is true.
			In fact, we could generalize this.
			Suppose we want to prove <m>P</m>.
			We know that at least one of the statements <m>Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n</m> is true.
			If we can show that <m>Q_1 \imp P</m> and <m>Q_2 \imp P</m> and so on all the way to <m>Q_n \imp P</m>, then we can conclude <m>P</m>.
			The key thing is that we want to be sure that one of our cases (the <m>Q_i</m>'s) must be true no matter what.
		</p>

		<p>
			If that last paragraph was confusing, perhaps an example will make things better.

			<statement>
				<p>
					Prove: For any integer <m>n</m>, the number <m>(n^3 -n)</m> is even.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					It is hard to know where to start this, because we don't know much of anything about <m>n</m>.
					We might be able to prove that <m>n^3 - n</m> is even if we knew that <m>n</m> was even.
					In fact, we could probably prove that <m>n^3-n</m> was even if <m>n</m> was odd.
					But since <m>n</m> must either be even or odd, this will be enough.
					Here's the proof.
				</p>


				<proof>
					<p>
						We consider two cases: if <m>n</m> is even or if <m>n</m> is odd.
					</p>

					<p>
						<u>Case 1</u>: <m>n</m> is even. Then <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. This give
						<md>
							<mrow>n^3 - n \amp = 8k^3 - 2k</mrow>
							<mrow>\amp = 2(4k^3 - k)</mrow>
						</md>,
						and since <m>4k^3 - k</m> is an integer, this says that <m>n^3-n</m> is even.
					</p>

					<p>
						<u>Case 2</u>: <m> n</m> is odd. Then <m>n = 2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. This gives
						<md>
							<mrow>n^3 - n \amp = (2k+1)^3 - (2k+1)</mrow>
							<mrow>\amp = 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1 - 2k - 1</mrow>
							<mrow>\amp = 2(4k^3 + 6k^2 + 2k)</mrow>
						</md>,
						and since <m>4k^3 + 6k^2 + 2k</m> is an integer, we see that <m>n^3 - n</m> is even again.
					</p>

					<p>
						Since <m>n^3 - n</m> is even in both exhaustive cases, we see that <m>n^3 - n</m> is indeed always even.
