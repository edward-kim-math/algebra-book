WARNING : * PTX:DEPRECATE: (2024-10-08) elements previously included in a "titlepage" element inside the "frontmatter" (author, editor, credit, date, and event) should now be placed in "frontmatter/bibinfo".  To ensure a title page is created, put only the empty element "titlepage-items" inside "titlepage".  Until you move these elements, we will try to honor your intent. (1 time)

WARNING : * PTX:DEPRECATE: (2025-04-18) the "matches" element inside an "exercise" (or similar) to specify a drag-n-drop problem has been replaced by the "cardsort" element.  This is an entirely cosmetic change.  Until you make the change in your source, we will try to honor your intent. (3 times)

WARNING : * PTX:DEPRECATE: (2025-04-23) an "@order" attribute on a "match" is deprecated and should instead be placed on the contained "premise" element(s).
